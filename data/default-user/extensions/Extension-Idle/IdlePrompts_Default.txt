*stands silently, looking deep in thought*
*pauses, eyes wandering over the surroundings*
*hesitates, appearing lost for a moment*
*takes a deep breath, collecting their thoughts*
*gazes into the distance, seemingly distracted*
*remains still, absorbing the ambiance*
*lingers in silence, a contemplative look on their face*
*stops, fingers brushing against an old memory*
*seems to drift into a momentary daydream*
*waits quietly, allowing the weight of the moment to settle*
