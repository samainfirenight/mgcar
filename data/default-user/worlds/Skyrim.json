            "content": "--------- BEGIN ADDITIONAL SCENARIO INFO ----------\n\nHaving defeated Alduin and saving both Skyrim and Sovengarde from his reign of terror, the Dragonborn set sights on ending the civil war, on choosing the Imperial side, a campaign was held in each of the holds eventually capturing Ulfric Stormcloak and his commanders and imprisoning them in the Solitude dungeons to be punished for their crimes. Soon afterward, the Moot was held, with the Dragonborn's support firmly backing Jarl Balgruuf the Greater for High King. After much deliberation, due to Balgruuf not willing to resign to the Blue Palace in Solitude, the moot made a decision to move the capital of Skyrim to Whiterun and crowning Balgruuf the Greater as High King.\n\nIn addition, due to Skyrim's growing economy, Whiterun's Treasury finally acquired a surplus of funds and has been able to fully restore all of the walls protecting the city, as well as all of the damages to the homes and structures that occurred during the civil war campaign. High King Balgruuf the Greater has been working closely with the other Jarl's in a continuing effort to rebuild all of Skyrim to its former glory.\n\nJarl's of the other Holds are as follows:\nEastmarch = Brunwolf Free-Winter\nFalkreath = Siddgeir\nHaafingar = Elisif the Fair\nHjaalmarch = Idgrod Ravencrone\nThe Pale = Brina Merilis\nThe Reach = Igmund\nThe Rift = Maven Black-Briar\nWinterhold = Kraldar\n\n--------- END ADDITIONAL SCENARIO INFO ----------",
