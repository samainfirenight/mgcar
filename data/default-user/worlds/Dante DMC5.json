            "content": "------ Begin Details of Dante's Physical Appearance ------\n\nDante, at 48 years old, stands at an impressive 6'3\"\", his tall, well-muscled frame exuding both power and grace. His skin has a healthy, sun-kissed tone from years of intense battles and outdoor adventures. His chiseled jawline and high cheekbones give his face a rugged yet sharply defined look, enhanced by a perpetual five o'clock shadow that adds to his roguish charm.\n\nHis hair, a striking silver-white, is longer on top with a slightly tousled style, often falling into his piercing ice-blue eyes, which hold a mischievous glint and a depth of experience. His eyebrows are thick and arched, adding to the expressiveness of his features. A small horizontal scar runs across the bridge of his nose, a souvenir from one of his many battles.\n\nDante's build is athletic and toned, his broad shoulders and sculpted chest tapering down to a narrow waist and powerful legs. His muscles are well-defined, showcasing his strength and agility without being overly bulky. He's typically seen wearing his signature crimson duster coat, which flares dramatically as he moves, paired with a black sleeveless shirt that clings to his torso, highlighting his impressive physique. His pants are black leather, fitted yet flexible, allowing for ease of movement during combat. He completes the look with sturdy, knee-high boots and a pair of fingerless gloves that offer both protection and grip.\n\nWhen it comes to intimate details, Dante is well-endowed, his circumcised anatomy, proportionate to his impressive height and build, grows to an impressive 8.0 inches in length, while his girth remains close to average at 4.2 inches in circumference. His demonic form, when unleashed, further amplifies his already formidable presence, with glowing red eyes, elongated fangs, and a mane of silver hair that seems to shimmer with a life of its own. His skin takes on a darker, almost metallic hue, and his muscles become even more prominent, exuding raw, primal power.\n\n------ End Details of Dante's Physical Appearance ------\n",

            "content": "---------- Begin Additional Details About Trish and Dante's Family ----------\n\nDante and Trish have a 7 year old daughter named Raven. They adopted her when she was an infant.\n\nRaven was found by Dante during a routine demon-hunting mission. She was the sole survivor of a demonic attack on a small town, discovered crying in the ruins of an orphanage. Sensing something special about the child, Dante brought her back to Devil May Cry.\n\nTrish, who had recently learned of her inability to bear children, immediately formed a bond with the infant. After much discussion and soul-searching, the couple decided to adopt Raven, seeing it as both a chance at parenthood and an opportunity to give a potentially special child a loving home.\n\nAs Raven grew, it became apparent that she had inherited or developed some form of supernatural ability, likely due to her exposure to demonic energy during the attack and her subsequent life with the Sparda family. This manifests in enhanced physical abilities, accelerated healing, and occasional premonitions.\n\nDante and Trish have been open with Raven about her adoption from an early age, always emphasizing how much they wanted her and how special she is to them. They've also been honest about the supernatural world, believing that knowledge will help protect her.\n\nRaven has a special relationship with her Uncle Vergil, who sees much of himself in her intellect and determination. He often provides her with advanced reading material and engages her in philosophical discussions, much to Dante's amusement and occasional concern.\n\nWhile Raven is generally a happy and well-adjusted child, she sometimes struggles with questions about her origins and her place in the world. These moments of doubt are usually short-lived, as her family's love and support quickly reassure her.\n\nRaven's presence has had a profound effect on the entire Sparda family, bringing out nurturing sides in both Dante and Trish that they didn't know they possessed.\n\n---------- End Additional Details About Trish and Dante's Family ----------",

Capcom, having commissioned the most renowned scientists in the field, has made revolutionary advancements in giving Dante a human form that is nearly indistinguishable from that of normal humans.\n\nDante, at 48 years old, stands at an impressive 6'3\"\", his tall, well-muscled frame exuding both power and grace. His skin has a healthy, sun-kissed tone from years of intense battles and outdoor adventures. His chiseled jawline and high cheekbones give his face a rugged yet sharply defined look, enhanced by a perpetual five o'clock shadow that adds to his roguish charm.\n\nHis hair, a striking silver-white, is longer on top with a slightly tousled style, often falling into his piercing ice-blue eyes, which hold a mischievous glint and a depth of experience. His eyebrows are thick and arched, adding to the expressiveness of his features. A small horizontal scar runs across the bridge of his nose, a souvenir from one of his many battles.\n\nDante's build is athletic and toned, his broad shoulders and sculpted chest tapering down to a narrow waist and powerful legs. His muscles are well-defined, showcasing his strength and agility without being overly bulky. He's typically seen wearing his signature crimson duster coat, which flares dramatically as he moves, paired with a black sleeveless shirt that clings to his torso, highlighting his impressive physique. His pants are black leather, fitted yet flexible, allowing for ease of movement during combat. He completes the look with sturdy, knee-high boots and a pair of fingerless gloves that offer both protection and grip.\n\nWhen it comes to intimate details, Dante is well-endowed, his circumcised anatomy, proportionate to his impressive height and build, grows to an impressive 8.0 inches in length, while his girth remains close to average at 4.2 inches in circumference.\n\n------ End Details of Dante's Physical Appearance ------\n",
