            "content": "------- Begin of Devil May Cry Timeline -------\n\nover the past 20 years gaming franchises often  dream of being an inspiration for all titles  \nwhich follow it paving the path forward  in either storytelling gameplay or design   is a feat accomplished by few but not all  are required to go down in history when  \na masterful design in the action genre is  capable of catapulting you to great heights   it can allow the other aspects to be a bit silly  but behind all of the quirky antics out there  \npersonalities and over-the-top action can be a  meaningful story that'll make even devils cry\ndevil may cry wasn't always the game we know today  in fact replaced the demons with zombies and the  \ntitle of the franchise to resident evil and you  get what the game almost was hideki kamiya might  \nbe more popularly associated with high octane  action games like devil may cry in bayonetta  \nbut he was originally in the horror genre he  directed resident evil 2 and that game went on to  \nbe a massive success despite his lack of interest  in the horror genre with the success of that game  \nhe was later sought after to create another entry  in the resident evil series specifically for its  \nfourth installment but this time around he would  be given complete creative control to do what he  \nwanted the result was a more stylized action  game the main character tony redgrave was an  \ninvincible man with skills and intellect beyond  that of a normal person they tried really hard  \nto make their main character and everything  around him cool but while it was a neat idea  \neverything began straying too far from what people  came to expect from a resident evil title the  \noriginal gameplay and horror elements were hardly  there anymore so instead the idea was shelved and  \nreworked to be its own independent title and thus  devil may cry was born the game was developed by  \nteam little devils a group of staff members within  capcom who designed everything from the ground up  \nthe main character's name was changed to dante  and the world was no longer infested with zombies  \nbut demons since the franchise has gone on  to produce five games multiple light novels  \nmanga animated series and other supplemental  material the timeline for some has become   confusing due to the order and fluctuating canon  these stories have gone in and out of so i thought  \nit was time i give you the complete unabridged  timeline of devil may cry let's rock baby\nThe Beginning\nlike most this story begins at creation darkness  was the first existing entity and from it spawned  \nthe demon world a hellish realm which was home  to nightmarish creatures demons are simply born  \nin this world and as such it is where their  true strength is held here demons can unleash  \ntheir full might and potential vying for power  it is in a demon's natural instinct to obtain  \npower and influence no matter the cost as such  they are very selfish and cruel never showing  \nremorse or pity to anyone or anything it needs to  step on to get there with such darkness plaguing  \nthe world it was inevitable that light was born as  well in other words the human world humans serve  \nas the light to the demons as darkness unlike  the demons humans are exceptionally weak  \nphysically speaking however come with a vast  array of emotions feelings and heart that the  \ndemons lack since the human world was born from  the darkness of the demon world it meant that the  \ntwo worlds were originally one this wrought havoc  on the humans and in a not quite specified event a  \ndemonic god wielding a giant spear separated the  two worlds giving independence to both the human  \nand demon world with it came an era of peace and  prosperity for the humans allowing them to thrive  \nwithout the threat of being murdered of course  there were their fair share of detractors   some humans sided with the demons and worshipped  them and so they created hell gates a portal which  \ncould be used to travel between both worlds they  are not the only method of one side traveling to  \nthe other but there are plenty of man-made portals  both large and small that were created meanwhile  \nin the demon world plays were being made for power  despite the chaos that is hell there is always  \none ruler who is the most powerful demon of  all and someone was looking to dethrone him the  \nearliest and most current ruler in this timeline  is unnamed but the one looking to challenge him  \nwas mundus also known as the prince of darkness  he is what many consider the epitome of evil  \nhe possesses a real god complex figuratively and  literally he dons the image of a muscular elderly  \nbearded man very reminiscent to the likes of zeus  or other christian gods but if you wanted to take  \ncontrol of the demon world he needed power beyond  his wildest dreams power which was unrivalled  \nfortunately for him he heard tell of the qliphoth  fruit it's a demonic tree grown in the underworld  \nthat when sufficiently nourished grows a fruit  that imbues that which ate it with divine power  \nit's such a rarity that it can only grow once  every few thousand years to nourish it however  \nit requires human blood the state in which it  grows is fairly unique as it is the inverse to  \nthat of a normal tree the roots are what break  their way to the surface spreading and sucking   the life out of any human it can find the qliphoth  is so powerful that it can even fuse the human and  \ndemon world back to one this fruit was perfect for  mundus and so he nourished his own qliphoth and ate  \nits fruit becoming one of the most powerful divine  demons in the underworld with its power he slayed  \nthe previous demon king and became the emperor of  the demon world with mundus as its ruler his reign  \nwas not without its challengers however as another  powerful demon named argusax challenged his rule  \neven despite having eaten the qliphoth fruit mundus  could not outright defeat argosac so easily he's  \nconsidered the most wicked deity by its followers  a great war was waged in the underworld with  \nneither one truly coming out as the victor as such  the demon world was effectively split into two  \nhalf ruled by mundus and the other by argosax  regardless this didn't seem to faze mundus as  \nhe had other plans to continue his rule figuring  that since the human and demon world were once  \none in the past it should be that way again but  with him ruling both he planned on leading an  \narmy of demons to conquer the world however faced  one completely unexpected form of resistance his  \nThe Legend of Sparda\nright-hand man and the greatest swordsman the  demon world had ever seen sparta objected to  \nhis conquest unlike the majority of demons sparta  exhibited many traits much more associated with  \nhumans he understood honor and possessed great  wisdom which he tried to pass down to his two  \napprentices he was courageous and honorable but  most importantly he had a heart a righteous one at  \nthat and seeing the tyranny and injustice mundus  was planning he chose to stand against not only  \nhim but the entire demon realm he held no malice  towards them or his own kind but he used his blade  \nto defend the weak sparta's rebellion was infamous  as he stood on the side of humanity he cleaved  \nand sliced his way through hordes of mundus's  minions until he stood face to face with him in  \nhis own chamber the two would have an arduous  duel against one another each exchanging blows  \nand battle damage while mundus almost gets the  upper hand sparta's tenacity to never give up and  \ncontinue fighting even at the cost of his own life  pushes him to overthrow the giant and seal him in  \na stone vault sparta emerged victorious and pushed  back all those who stood on mundus's side back  \ninto the demon realm as such humanity worshipped  the kindness he showed the morale of his character  \nto defend the helpless even when they had nothing  to offer him he instantaneously became a legend  \nhis rebellion obviously didn't sit well with those  in the demon world as such to ensure the safety  \nof humanity he chose to stay in their world and  worked diligently to ensure demons could no longer  \nattempt something like that again it was not  easy as the gateway between worlds was enabled  \nthanks to a structure called the temen ni gru as it  serves as the true portal to the demon world it  \nwould also serve as the lock he would use to keep  it shut sparta implemented many fail-safes to its  \nstructure he stripped the names of seven powerful  demons each representing the seven vices staking  \nthem to the ground as seals various gatekeepers  were left behind within the tower to protect it  \nbut most importantly of all he poured all of his  demonic energy into his sword robbing him of the  \nmajority of his abilities in doing so it closed  the door between realms he used his blood and the  \nblood of a human priestess to close the gateway  and a mystical amulet also known as the perfect  \namulet was crafted and serves as the key to this  whole seal with that the true gateway was closed  \nno longer with his signature sword he had crafted  two others to represent the other aspects of him  \nthe sparta holds and thus represents his raw power  the rebellion embodies his retaliation against the  \ndemon world and the yamato a god of death to him  these three traits embody who he is and as such  \nthe weapons would be very meaningful to him as  well as powerful his journey did not end there  \nwhile the temen ni gru might be the true gateway  there were still plenty of other portals demons  \ncould use to get to the human realm hell gates  were another method but there was only really  \none that is considered a true hell gate it was  located in a city called fortuna and so sparta  \nmade his way there to seal it he used the yamato  to lock the gate so no demons could come through  \nhowever this one was more of just a key if someone  got their hands on the yamato they too could  \nre-open the gate just as easily as he locked  it for a short period of time he benevolently  \nruled over fortuna as its feudal lord while many  worshiped him as a god here life pulled him in  \nmany directions he was summoned by protectors of  an island called v de marley for his help a small  \ngroup of devil worshipers on the island began  worshiping argusax and eventually summoned him to  \nthe human world the protectors attempted to banish  him but couldn't and so called upon the help of  \nsparta who even despite his lack of powers still  worked with the protectors and successfully sealed  \nhim away with four relics he lived on the human  world for two 000 years and while everyone knew  \nthe name of sparta then as time passed his story  slipped into legend he became a figure that people  \nthought was just the story if people even knew it  to begin with he faded out of the public eye and  \nless and less people were aware of the name sparta  it was the natural evolution of time not that he  \nactually cared about the notoriety but probably  the most important venture he took as a human  \nwas that of love he met a beautiful woman with  blonde hair dark eyes and a fair complexion while  \nunknown how she snagged the heart of the dark  knight she fell in love with him and possessed her  \nown special fire her name was eva while we are not  witness to much of their time together we know she  \nwas important enough to him that they got married  and had two twins the boys names were dante  \nand vergil due to the nature of their parents the  two were half-demon half-human they were still  \nable to utilize demonic power but didn't come with  the completely selfish nature most demons are born  \nwith sparta had also gifted eva the amulet he used  to seal the demon world some time when they first  \nmet while forever preventing demons from ever  making their way to the human world was a nigh  \nimpossible task he certainly made it difficult  for them to try the job was executed as well as  \nhe could have and so decided to try his hand at  simply living with the demon world sealed off  \nEva/Dante/Vergil\nand nothing more to seemingly worry about sparta  was allowed to live life like a human and with his  \nfamily they lived in a remote home in red grave  city tucked away from many neighbors as they were  \ngrowing up sparta trained dante and vergil how to  wield a sword and even passed down the weapons he  \nforged the rebellion was entrusted to dante while  the yamato to vergil unfortunately living life  \nwith his family wouldn't last too long as during  some unknown event sparta disappeared it's been  \nstated by many that he died but why where and how  is all unknown all that is important is that from  \nthis point moving forward sparta is gone eva was  then left to raise the two boys all by herself  \nfortunately by the sounds of it even despite  being half demons raising them was just like   raising any other child stressful as practice  dante and vergil would frequently fight with  \neach other sparring with their training swords as  well as fighting over the most mundane of things  \nbut they did have their fair share of brotherly  bonding particularly in their use of the   catchphrase jackpot as a memoriam and keepsake to  remember their father eva split the perfect amulet  \nthat he gifted her into two halves giving each one  to both dante and vergil on their eighth birthday\npersonality wise dante himself is a bit of an  outgoing extroverted kid who enjoys getting rough  \nand fighting while vergil was kind of the opposite  he was much more reserved while he still trained  \nwith his brother vergil had a keen interest in  literature particularly for poetry and the works  \nof william blake the man who vergil went to who  collected these books gifted a collection to him  \nas he genuinely seemed fond and passionate about  the work to mark the book for himself so dante  \nwouldn't steal it vergil wrote the letter v on  the cover to signify that it was his this book  \nwould be very important to him as he would  continue carrying it into and throughout his   adult life unfortunately the worst possible fate  befell their family due to his rebellion sparta  \nmade many enemies seeking revenge for what he did  but possibly the most dangerous enemy he made and  \ndidn't choose to kill was mundus he was infuriated  with his defeat at the hands of his once trusted  \ncomrade and so took the most evil route he could  with sparta no longer around he went after his  \nfamily on one unsuspecting evening a demon attack  was launched on their family home dante and eva  \nwere inside and doing what only a mother would  do she attempted to protect her children she hid  \ndante in a closet and left him with one final  message in case she didn't return i need to  \nfind vergil i promise i'll be back i know this is  hard you must listen to me be a big boy a man huh\nif i don't return you must run by  yourself alone you must change your name  \nforget your past and start a new life  there's someone else a new beginning\nand with that she ran off in a desperate attempt  to find vergil unfortunately for everyone involved  \nshe could not find him in time and was killed by  demons inside as their house burned to a crisp\nwhere vergil was was on their playground  just outside their house where he was  \nambushed by demons as well he was impaled  stabbed and skewered by their blades  \nand left to die but fortunately thanks to his  demon blood he survived the onslaught it didn't  \nchange that he was scared and wanted help most  desperately from his mother to come and save him  \nbut she never did so he was forced to act himself  it is here his inner demon awakens and he summons  \nthe yamato by complete accident laying waste  to every demon in sight as his house burned to  \nash the poor child was left believing that his  mother abandoned him this gave him the belief  \nthat he could only rely on himself for protection  if he never wanted to get hurt again and to be  \nable to protect those he cared about the only  way he figured he could do that was with power\nTony Redgrave / Devil May Cry (novel)\nfrom this point moving forward we would largely  follow the story of dante after the incident at   his home he not only believed that his mother was  killed but his brother as well as he was nowhere  \nto be found in the aftermath as such he heeded  his mother's last words and changed his name  \nhe chose to name himself after the city he grew up  in going under the new name tony redgrave for the  \nsake of continuity and not being confused i will  continue referring to dante as dante but be aware  \nthat he is going under the alias of tony redgrave  despite this he did not seek a new or normal life  \ninstead dedicating himself to avenging his mother  by killing demons he used the alias not as a  \ncomplete shield to prevent demons from finding  him altogether but as a way so he could hone   his practice and swordsmanship when he was first  coming up he of course wielded his father's gift  \nto him the rebellion as his primary weapon one of  the earliest places we are aware that dante lived  \nwhen he was a child was called morris island  not much information exists from his time here  \nother than he made friends with another kid named  ernest by the sounds of it they were really great  \nchildhood friends even burying their own treasure  box and promising to never tell anyone where it   was the curious thing about dante's childhood  here is the people's recollection of his mother  \nevo was most certainly dead as he was going  by tony and it's never been mentioned about   dante having another woman take care of him it  could be that he lied about her and he lived  \nalone but by the way the people speak it sounds  like they actually saw and interacted with her  \nregardless of this my new detail tragedy would  yet again follow him a powerful demon which we  \ncan only presume was in search of him and sensed  his powerful bloodline attacked the town setting  \neverything ablaze nearly everyone was killed and  those who survived blamed dante and his mother  \nas such they left the town in search of new  horizons if dante's mother from morris island  \nwas real then she died shortly after as dante  became independent and grew into his teen years\nas the years passed by and dante became more  capable he found the perfect profession to  \ncontinue hunting demons and make some money in the  process being a mercenary it was a profession that  \nthose who had largely congregated at bobby's  cellar it's a dive bar where mercenaries and  \ninformation brokers do business dante didn't take  just any job as he had certain philosophies he'd  \ntry and stick to considering no one knew about  demons the jobs that he did take he first had to  \nbe interested in but they would also be the ones  that sounded unusual if he had a hunch about how  \nweird it sounded he would likely accepted the job  as chances were it likely involved demons despite  \nbeing a young teenager at the time he built up  his own reputation making many new acquaintances   along the way one of the most important  was an information broker named enzo farino  \na short-statured italian-american he's one of the  best most reliable information brokers in the city  \nand has built up a prestigious reputation amongst  mercenaries his job is to act as the middleman  \nand find jobs that need doing picking out the  best mercenary that fits the client's needs  \ndante was easily the best mercenary around and  so it was clear that enzo would seek him out  \nas a partner and partners they became dante  was offered many jobs by enzo but as stated  \nwould only pick the ones that seemed unusual or  interested him much to the chagrin of enzo though  \nhe wasn't aware of the existence of demons dante  also gained a partner on the field who took  \non many jobs with him named gru he's a father  of three daughters and is slightly too old to  \nstill be in the profession of mercenary but like  most he still needs the money but probably the   most important and impactful person dante would  meet here was nell goldstein the local gunsmith  \ndante visited here frequently as despite his sword  being able to withstand any battle damage incurred  \nany guns he used were unable to keep up with  his trigger finger and always wound up broken  \nthe relation between the two grew over time  nothing romantic but more of a familial relation  \nmel would treat dante like her own child which she  had and he reminded her of and berate him at just  \nabout every opportunity and likewise dante began  seeing nell as a mother figure but everything  \nchanged when a new mercenary came to town gilver  a mysterious bandaged man sporting a green suit  \nand wielding a slim katana looking to join a  group of popular mercenaries upon his arrival he  \nchooses to pick a fight with the strongest one  around which of course happened to be dante to  \neveryone's surprise the two go toe to toe and he  proves himself so physically capable that a winner  \nis undetermined this quickly put gilbert on a high  demand hiring list unlike dante gilver took on any  \njob that came his way and thanks to his incredibly  calm attitude and generous personality he won over  \nthe favor of pretty much the entire mercenary  guild but as you likely could expect gilver  \nwas not actually a friendly ally rather he was a  demon under the service of mundus with the trust  \nhe had gained he slowly lured in and had the other  mercenaries killed and turned into demons his plan  \nwas to slowly allow the darkness to distort and  manifest all of the human world he went to many  \ngreat lengths to hide his identity even killing  an innocent man who was simply looking into who he   actually was his presence did make few suspicious  such as nell herself she was aware of the victim  \nwho was looking into gilver's identity turning up  dead but she also saw something with her own eyes  \nwhen gilver visited her shop she saw his shadow  on the ground not mirror the man he appeared as  \nbut rather an armored knight of sorts this made  her wary and she disclosed these worries to dante  \nbut one of the most important kills came from  the likes of gru desperate for money to support  \nhis daughters he took on an assassination request  and his target was gilver unfortunately for him  \nthe job went about as well as expected guilford  was much too experienced and skilled and thus gru  \nwas killed instead his eldest daughter jessica  also fell ill and thanks to the demonic influence  \nseeping out from the underworld she began  hallucinating about demons she was pulled  \ninto the demon world and fused with a demonic  tree that began using her pain and despair to  \ngrow a path to the human world dante caught wind  of jessica's hallucinations and quickly rushed  \nover to the sanatorium she was held at only to  find it had transformed into a portal he traversed  \nhis way through where he inevitably found jessica  unfortunately there was nothing dante could do to  \nsave her no human could survive what the demon  world twisted her into and she already showed  \nvery little signs of response so he did the only  thing he could and put her out of her misery  \nthe deaths of both gru and jessica would remain  a mystery to the townsfolk only speculation and  \nrumors began spreading with of course the blame  being shifted onto dante with all of these events  \nboiling together it was getting closer and closer  to the final confrontation but the catalyst that  \nreally set the events in motion was when nell's  shop was targeted she had been spending pretty  \nmuch all of her time in this story tinkering on  some unknown project and when a surprise explosion  \nengulfs her shop dante immediately rushes in to  investigate only to find her still calmly working  \ndespite his warnings about the fire she ignores  everything instead choosing to showcase her  \nmasterpiece she had crafted two pistols specially  designed to withstand dante's trigger finger they  \nwere unlike any other weapon she had crafted  before and the best thing she would ever invent  \nto make them truly his she had him assemble the  final parts the pistols were named ebony and  \nivory an inscription lay etched on the side of the  barrel marking for tony redgrave by 45 art works  \na misspelling she purposefully made in honor of  her son with her masterpiece completed she fell to  \nthe ground revealing she had a large gash sliced  across her back yet again helpless to do anything  \nall dante could do was sit there with her in her  final moments the image of dante reminded her of  \nher own child rock as she struggled to speak to  him before she eventually passed away in his arms  \nthe death of nell struck a particularly sore chord  with dante despite how close the two were and how  \nimportant they wound up being to one another it  made him realize that he lied to her she only ever  \nknew tony redgrave she never had the full truth  of who he was or what he did and so dying without  \neven knowing his real name he hated it and to lose  yet another mother figure to the likes of demons  \nit reminded him of his past by changing his name  the result stayed the same nothing was actually  \nchanging except the people he was close to were  pushed away by a lie the change that he wanted was  \nkilling demons and he didn't need an alias to do  that so instead he chose to abandon tony redgrave  \ncompletely he embraced the name of dante choosing  to move forward as himself reigning hell amongst  \nall demons and using nell's pistols to do so the  story would of course lead to a confrontation  \nbetween dante and gilver with the two exchanging  blows the real twist of the story comes when dante  \nshoots the bandages off of his face revealing it  to be vergil this would not be the actual vergil  \nhowever in reality it was a demon created  by mundus in the likeness of him these were  \nknown as angelos an experiment by mundus to copy  sparta and his son's abilities he tried using data  \nfrom observing dante and vergil's fight however  unfortunately nothing could quite replicate the  \nreal thing gilver is defeated and would fade away  with all of the other demonic power that tried to  \nconsume the human world after everything dante was  left feeling quite remorseful and empathetic to  \nall that was lost here especially to the likes  of his old partner gru not only did he die but  \ndante was personally responsible for killing his  eldest daughter because of his guilt he opens up  \na bank account for his remaining two daughters as  a way to say sorry he would frequently send what  \nlittle money he had to them for the foreseeable  future and with that he left town for new horizons\nwith yet another chapter of dante's life behind  him we enter a more modern era of history  \ndante now currently around the age of 18. while  he leaves behind much that he had in the novel  \none thing he did take with him was enzo being one  of his most profitable agents he likely decided to  \nfollow him into town when he moved in fact it was  him who helped him secure an office space for his  \nfreelancing business which dante hadn't named yet  enzo himself rented out a room at the love planet  \nstrip club right next door for the most part  their dynamic of business would remain the same  \nenzo would provide jobs and dante would only  take the ones that interested him this new   chapter of history also saw the reintroduction  of vergil the last time we saw him he was a kid  \nVergil's Visit to Fortuna\nset off to attain more power and since then he  has however not nearly as much as he would have  \nliked during his ventures he traveled to the city  of fortuna where sparta once ruled to investigate  \nthe organization known as the order of the sword  they're a militant religion which worships sparta  \nwith the objective to eradicate all demons vergil  was curious to learn what their true objective was  \nand to learn more about his father so he  investigated himself what he discovered was  \ntheir desire for power he leaves uncertain whether  or not he can call them misguided but is adamant  \nthat true power lies in the blood of sparta  well i can't exactly call them misguided\nbut soon they shall know this devil's power   a power greater than they ever  imagined the power of a son of sparta  \nthe city of fortuna and the order of the sword  will be greatly expanded and explained upon   further down the timeline what is surprisingly  important and almost out of character for vergil  \nwas a personal detour he took whilst in the city  in an unexpected twist he slept with a woman there  \nand unknowingly got her pregnant who this woman is  remains a mystery as far as fan speculation goes  \nmany presume it is the woman in red seen drawing  her eye towards him when he first arrives  \nregardless a woman would be pregnant and there  would be yet another blood of sparta to be born  \nDevil May Cry 3 (manga)\nthere is also an entirely new set of characters  that need to be introduced for this chapter   and that would be the family of a man named arkham  he was married to a woman named kalina anne and  \nthey gave birth to a daughter whom he named  mary by unexplained or perhaps pure coincidence  \nmary had inherited the blood of the legendary  priestess sparta had slain to seal the temen ni gru  \nthe true portal to the demon world arkham  himself was a scholar who studied in the   black arts and became obsessed with the legend  of sparta he wanted to attain the same level of  \npower as he had and rule the world as its god  in his pursuit of power he sacrificed his wife  \nkalina in a ritual for demonic influence however  it resulted in failure he suffered a severe burn  \nscar on the side of his head and the demonic power  he did gain certainly wasn't what he was looking  \nfor he obtained multiple alter egos his most  popular one was jester as such he did inherit  \na multitude of different dark magic abilities but  none that were capable of being hailed as godlike  \nhe could switch between both personalities  at will and it was not impossible to assume   that they were the same person due to the  drastic difference in demeanor they both had  \nbut that's a very niche situation the sacrifice  of her mother obviously didn't sit well with  \nmary she disowned her father and renounced her  name and chose to walk down the path of a devil  \nhunter as she had become well-versed in their  existence thanks to her father with the passage  \nof time arkham came to learn much about the temen  nagru and sparta he was practically an expert  \npretty much anything about everything relating  to sparta and how he sealed the demon world away  \narkham knows since sparta sealed his demonic  power inside his blade to use as a seal he  \nfigured that if he could claim the sword he  could simply inherit sparta's power left behind  \nthe problem that lied in his way were all of the  fail-safes implemented by the dark knight which  \nmade it nearly impossible for someone to just  break firstly were the seven sin demons who had  \ntheir names stripped to be released their names  had to be returned to them but could only be done  \nby someone related to sparta the gatekeepers stand  as guards within the building they need the blood  \nof a descendant of a pure priestess whom he'd used  to help seal the tower which coincidentally just   so happened to be his daughter and the blood of  sparta as his blood was also used and on top of  \nall of that he made a key the perfect amulet which  he gave to ava which she had since split into two  \nand given to dante and vergil arkham was aware of  all of this it's how dedicated he was to attaining  \npower amongst his research he would of course  become aware of dante and vergil so you'd imagine  \nhis surprise when vergil wandered into his library  searching for a book knowing exactly who he is he  \ntakes the opportunity to regale him with the tale  of his own father the tale of the demon warrior  \nthat's not what i'm looking for leave me\nthen what are you looking for\na demon that impregnates a  woman who then bears twin\nthat's sons story isn't it\nleave me i won't tell you a third time despite  vergil's initial dismissiveness arkham's  \ndedication and lack of fear towards demonic  teaching piques his interest he discloses his  \nplan to raise the temen ni gru and how it can  be used to harness the true power of sparta  \namongst the many things arkham is aware of  vergil's desire for power is one of them what  \nvergil doesn't know is that arkham wants the  power for himself while he doesn't fully sway  \nvergil into considering him an ally since he is  incapable of raising the temen ni gru by himself  \nas he lacks the knowledge necessary to go at it  alone he is forced to ally himself with arkham in  \nan effort to shatter the seal to the demon world  as a prelude to the events of devil may cry 3 a  \ntwo-volume manga series was released to set the  scene set one year before the events of the game  \nthe whole plan to break the seal to the demon  world was pretty much spearheaded by arkham the   problem he currently faced was in regards to dante  while allying with vergil virtually solved all of  \nhis problems both of the brothers were needed to  break the seal or more accurately their amulets  \narkham's methods when it came to dante were much  more subtle with the intention focused primarily  \non scouting just how capable he was there are a  lot of one-off characters introduced here that  \naren't exactly specified their identity or  allegiance for example we are introduced to  \nthe likes of the mad hatter the white rabbit and  alice all plays on the alice in wonderland story  \nbut demons seemingly on the side of arkham  details within the story would indicate that  \nthe mad hatter is actually arkham himself  similar to how he can transform into jester  \nthe mad hatter is one of his personas as well  the white rabbit is but a puppet being controlled  \nand alice is most certainly a demon working  for arkham and his interest hearing about his   demon hunting business arkham hired dante for  4 million to rescue a little girl named alice  \nthe story was that she willingly ran away from  home where she was lured in by a demon who was   trying to steal her purity everything took place  in an old abandoned mansion dante was forced to  \nfight waves of demons leaving a trail of corpses  in his path to make his hack and slash adventure  \nshort the story concludes with him not rescuing  alice as that was never truly the point of the job  \nand she had no desire of leaving the mad hatter  is also the one who drops the bombshell to dante  \nthat vergil is still alive and in town the reason  he does so is devoid of logic and doesn't make  \nmuch sense even in context but after seeing what  he's seen dante ignores these words believing them  \nto perhaps be nothing more than a psychological  tactic however the difference this time  \nis something in his gut says otherwise the  revelation that his brother might still be alive  \neven after he takes his leave still shakes him and  they even brush shoulders while walking down the  \nmansion's hallway but when dante looks back vergil  is already gone the second volume of the manga  \nfocuses slightly more on vergil and the steps he  and arkham are taking to release the temen ni gru  \nin this case it is the renaming of the seven  sin demons the two have been going around  \nreturning their names slowly but surely arkham  even attempts to lure in dante yet again and  \ntrick him into renaming one of the sins however  he doesn't fall for it in fact it would be during  \nthis ruse that the reunion between brothers would  happen as this demon was on vergil's path when he  \ncame to release it dante was already there it's  anything but a heartwarming reunion of brothers  \nwhile dante starts off playful considering that he  thought vergil to have been dead all of this time  \nit is quickly made clear the opposing intentions  they both hold dante tells him that he's become a  \ndemon hunter and vergil tells him about his plan  to break the seal reopening the gateway to the  \ndemon world this shocks dante and he even attempts  to remind him how it was demons who killed their  \nmother a fact that vergil is fully aware of but  is unswayed with dante's goal to kill all demons  \nand vergils to use its power it was clear that  they had different values and views of the world  \na fight between the two quickly results with dante  losing and vergil almost claiming his half of the  \namulet before he decides to give it back claiming  that he can take it whenever he wants from here  \nthe two leave taking their separate paths dante  vergil and arkham weren't the only characters  \naround in the story however as arkham's daughter  mary is also in town she serves a much more  \nsubdued and muted role in the events of the manga  but still has her own set path she's traveling  \ndown it can largely be summed up as her being  around in search of her father while she doesn't  \nget actively involved with demons she does get  roped in with a small side story with alice as she  \nwas walking down the street mary saw a distraught  young girl on the side of the road and decided to  \nhelp she proclaims that she's lost but possesses  a map to her supposed home mary assists her and  \nguides her to what winds up being dante's shop  the truth is alice is in pursuit of his amulet and  \nmary is along for the ride alice becomes demonic  which pushes mary to take refuge in the bathroom  \nas she's without her weapons while she waits for  dante to return upon his arrival he immediately  \nsniffs her out which causes her to run away he  doesn't give chase as she doesn't seem like a   threat this causes dante to lower his guard and he  places his amulet on his desk while he intends on  \ntaking a shower but during this moment alice yet  again appears and snatches the amulet running away  \nto which dante finally gives chase this was the  event that pulled dante into fighting the seven  \nsin where he was reunited with vergil mary leaves  the building unseen and her story ends there there  \nwas an unreleased third volume of the manga which  was intended to focus primarily on her however was  \nnever released so her story takes an abrupt ending  all in all it can be summed up with her demon  \nhunting journey leading her to the city so she can  kill her father and avenge her mother in honor of  \nher the weapon she wields a rocket launcher was  named after her as the kalina anne one year would  \neventually pass from the end of the manga in the  brothers clash to the beginning of the game vergil  \noff-screen would inevitably rename the seven sins  and the events of the game would be set in motion  \nDevil May Cry 3\ndevil may cry 3 opens up with arkham meeting dante  face to face for the first time in his actual body  \nvergil has decided to reach out to dante since  their last clash reinviting him in for another  \nchallenge to try and stop him arkham's invitation  consists of a whole plethora of demons for dante  \nto slash his way through but the true sign that  vergil's plan to release the demon world was in   motion was the re-emergence of the temen ni gru this  not only grabs the attention of dante but arkham's  \ndaughter as well having been pursuing the town in  search of him the clear sign of dark arts meant  \nthis was unmistakably where she could find him  and take her revenge both of the characters  \nwould ascend the tower simultaneously with dante  facing much more of the safeguards put in place by   his father the gatekeepers cerberus agnian rudra  nevin beowulf and guryon all stand as honorable  \nadversaries but are bested and go on to serve new  uses as devil arms to make sure dante made his way  \nto the top arkham helped serve as a guide under  the guise of jester he only appears when he needs  \nto feed dante new information or nudge him in a  certain direction during his path up the tower he  \nalso crossed paths with mary their interactions  are anything but friendly on her end often  \nresorting to violence as being so close to her  father all she can see is red vergil becomes aware  \nof her presence and arkham is forced to disclose  their relation which puts an even more wary vergil  \neven more on edge with his supposed partner to  put him at ease arkham states how he'll get rid  \nof her resorting in a father-daughter reunion  considering he needs her blood to break the  \nseal he only tosses her off the building believing  in her capacity to survive this way he can feign  \nthe argument to vergil that he tried killing  her without being obvious that he needs her  \nthis attempt at tricking him in some ways does  and doesn't work vergil comes to the belief that  \nhe's still holding on to bits of his humanity  which are unnecessary for their plans seeing  \nhim as not fully committed to their goals vergil  stabs him of course the truth of the situation  \nand the relevance of her blood is unknown to  vergil amongst other things he's unaware of  \nis arkham's demonic power which makes the wound  he just suffered non-lethal vergil would advance  \ninto the tower seeing no further use for  him meanwhile on top of the tower a clash  \nbetween brothers would ensue while both adamant in  their goals vergil is the one who gains the upper  \nhand and impales his brother intending to kill him  but you see this entire time dante has been living  \nwith one hand tied behind his back certain demons  can unlock what is known as a devil trigger it's a  \nform that can allow someone to harness and utilize  enhanced demonic strength vergil unlocked his when  \nhe was a kid during the tragedy and since then  he's been honing its power but dante's just been  \ngoing about things his own way but ironically he's  always had the ability to unlock his devil trigger  \nbecause of his sword sparta made the rebellion  to be a physical manifestation of dante's power  \nto activate it it just needed his blood but  because he was unaware of that his powers  \nremained dormant this entire time that was until  vergil plunged the rebellion through his chest  \ninstead of killing him the sword finally was able  to react to its purpose and unlocked dante's devil  \ntrigger while vergil is initially surprised he  knows exactly the power dante has just gained high  \non the overwhelming force dante is initially in  a zombie-like state but with power to be obtained  \nin both halves of the amulet acquired there  were more pressing matters at hand for vergil   after recovering from his devil trigger dante is  reinvigorated with all sorts of new energy and  \nconsidering he's not dead that means vergil still  needs to be stopped so he simply continues on his  \npath through the tower as for the journey of dante  and mary the two would cross paths several more  \ntimes dante's the one who initially caught  her after her father threw her off the tower   and it's where she learns that he's a demon after  shooting him in the head and he doesn't die after  \ntaking down the leviathan the two encounter once  more and it's where mary gets her new name what's  \nyour name i don't have a name okay then what  should i call you i don't care whatever you want  \nwhatever lady while i have been calling her  mary this whole time despite the fact that  \nshe renounced it long ago and didn't go by any  name i had to call her something and didn't want  \nto get ahead of the timeline she from this point  moving forward would be more popularly known as  \nlady despite leaving her behind the two would yet  again rendezvous at the supposed corpse of arkham  \nbeing infuriated that he wasn't killed by her own  hands lady and dante have a little scuffle but it  \nceases after she airs out all of the baggage that  she's been carrying around about him once dante  \ntakes his leave arkham uses the opportunity to  manipulate his daughter further he pretends vergil  \nwas controlling him this entire time and that  he truly did love his family and was a victim  \nto his evil and twisted plans lady falls for the  bait and sets forth further up the tower to take  \nrevenge on vergil who's finalizing his plans as we  currently speak as intended vergil's restoration  \nof the perfect amulet along with his blood are  not enough to raise the tower which comes much  \nto his confusion why isn't this working is there  something missing must more blood be shed dante  \nalso arrives and so he figures that by adding his  blood that might be what's needed to undo the seal  \nthus resulting in yet another clash between  brothers as the blood of sparta's offsprings  \nfill the chamber lady arrives seeking revenge on  vergil as well where the truth about everything is  \nrevealed arkham reveals himself to still be alive  as well as his deception in pretty much all of the  \ncharacters donning the persona of both jester and  his human form he finalizes the components needed  \nto truly awaken the temen ni gru with the tower now  awakened arkham opens a path to the demon world  \nwhere he claims his long-awaited prize sparta's  sword he uses the amulet to activate it and pull  \nit from its stone upon grasping the blade all of  sparta's demonic power begins flowing through him  \nand he even takes the form of the legendary dark  knight but considering he just made an enemy out  \nof all three characters everyone was biting at  the opportunity to take him down lady finds it  \nher responsibility since he's her father but dante  finds it his responsibility considering his father  \ntechnically created the whole mess in the first  place and she wouldn't be powerful enough to take   him down anyway it is within this moment where  she begins to understand him despite his demon  \nheritage she's caught a glimpse of a demon who's  fighting for humanity and a human who's just as  \nevil as a demon she accepts dante's character and  what he's standing for and gives him her rocket  \nlauncher in exchange for his name and with that  dante makes his way to the demon world as well  \nafter coming face to face with arkham despite  donning the appearance of his father the   overwhelming power causes him to transform into  something much more reflective of the darkness  \ninside his heart while dante initially faces him  alone partway through the battle vergil joins the  \nfray seeking the power that was stolen from him  together the two brothers team up and take down  \nthe horrific creature they even get to once again  use their childhood catchphrase together jackpot\narkham is cast back to the human world where he  lands in front of his daughter this time around  \nhe doesn't hold back in expressing his desires  for becoming a god while he still attempts to   manipulate lady and asks that she help him she  refuses and kills the monster she's wanted to  \nfor so long despite what everything would indicate  lady was heavily distraught by this moment while  \nshe often spoke about how she only had one parent  in the form of her mother context clues would   say otherwise it seems that there was a point in  history where she loved her father and vice versa  \nhowever after he murdered his wife lady tried to  drown out her emotions with anger the end result  \nwas still her crying over the loss of her family  with arkham out of the picture it left sparta's  \nsword up for the taking vergil clearly seeks its  power and dante looks to keep it out of his hands  \nas they've done countless times before to settle  the matter the two fight unfortunately for  \nvergil this time he is bested at the hands of his  brother he is wounded so heavily that he is forced  \nto leave sparta's sword behind instead choosing  to keep his half of their mother's amulet  \nleaving the true power within the sword yet  again dormant with the portal connecting both  \nworlds closing vergil chooses to descend into the  demon world as it is where their father came from  \nand he seeks to be just like him  despite dante's attempt to save him   vergil slashes his hand preventing him  so he won't get trapped there as well  \ndante is forced to return to the human world  also distraught and saddened over the events   that transpired which comes much to the shock  of even lady are you crying it's only the rain  \nthe rain already stopped\nthe devils never cry i see\nmaybe somewhere out there even a devil may  cry when he loses a loved one don't you think  \nmaybe with everything seeming to  have been settled the two joined  \nforces dante was finally able to open and  find a name for his shop the devil may cry  \nand the two would continue their  profession of demon hunting\nvergil's fate would unfortunately not be so  uplifting having returned to the demon world  \nhe encounters mundus himself harboring a grudge  against what he did and blinded by the idea of  \npower flowing through his veins he rushes into  battle against him figuring that if sparta could  \ndefeat him so could he unfortunately he failed he  was too weakened from his battle with dante that  \neven posing a threat to mundus was impossible  vergil was defeated and his sword the yamato  \nwas shattered in the battle as punishment mundus  strung up his bloody and beaten body torturing him  \nmocking him for being a half-breed while vowing  to remove his human heart will and ego vergil  \nover the span of ten years would get corrupted and  tortured it was a living nightmare he was forced  \nto experience it was not an easy task on the part  of mundus i mind you vergil refused to give in and  \nrested control of his own will for a long time it  wasn't until mundus returned his mother's amulet  \nto him which he stole that it made him into one  of his puppets the sentimental part that existed  \nwithin him managed to drop his guard and thus  vergil was corrupted and was renamed nelo angelo  \nit was around this time dante would also make a  very important business partner named jd morrison  \nhe does have two separate character designs as it  was later changed but both would be the same man  \nhe's not actually a new character relatively  speaking as his story would go he was one of  \nthe many brokers who frequented bobby zeller  and worked with dante when he was tony redgrave  \nwhile enzo was the one dante mostly went to he did  take jobs from morrison from time to time as well  \nonce dante left changed his name and opened devil  may cry morrison later tracked him down learned  \nof his name change and became a business partner  the dynamic between morrison and enzo would switch  \nmorrison would then become dante's main  broker after he became accustomed to the   whole existence of demons while enzo  showed up with the occasional odd job\nDevil May Cry 1\nas stated the events that span between devil may  cry 3 and 1 are 10 years dante goes from an 18  \nyear old amateur to a 29 year old professional  demon hunter sometime during that period he  \nand lady parted ways she went off to do her own  solo demon hunting but kept in touch every now  \nand then with jobs that she couldn't do herself  for the most part dante's life didn't change  \nthe person who was making moves in this time was  moondis enough time had passed since his last  \ndefeat against sparta he felt now was the right  time to try and invade the human world once more  \nwith the temen ni gru no longer operable he figured  he might have better chances opening a gate  \non malay island what makes this island so special  is that it is the closest physical location to the  \nunderworld in the human domain once established  as a citadel the occupants quickly experienced the  \nstrange happenings that the island possessed  time flowing differently in certain areas   crops growing out of season and terrifying  nightmares suffered by those who lived here  \nsince then the island has become a derelict of  time demonic influence has since warped and taken  \nhold of just about everything there to remain a  mystery the island's location changes every night  \nand appears in unexpected locations finding it can  be damn near impossible unless you already know  \nwhere it's going to be part of mundus's plan was  also killing sparta's remaining descendant dante  \nto save himself the hassle he wanted to lure him  to the island and to do so he created a demon to  \npsychologically manipulate him a demon was created  in perfect likeness of his and vergil's mother  \nlengthy blonde hair blue eyes and a fair  complexion she was a mirror image of their mother  \ntrish was her name she possessed the supernatural  powers of most demons like increased strength  \nspeed agility and so on but her most iconic power  would be her ability to control electricity it was  \nher job to lure in dante and so she set forth  towards his shop to hire him trish makes quite  \na bold first impression first showcasing knowledge  of who he is but more importantly his a vengeance  \nno one up until this point had ever really been  aware of dante's personal goal she reveals herself  \nto be a demon and gets into a small little scuffle  to make sure he really is the son of sparta dante  \nproves himself more than capable but just before  he goes to shoot her she actually reveals that she   needs his help as planned due to her resemblance  to his mother dante accepts her request\nshe guides him to malay island as thanks to mundus  she's aware of its location to be frank a lot  \nof dante's journey around the island is hardly  worthy of note only three of mundus's generals  \ninhabit it and attempt to stop him phantom a giant  molten arachnid griffin a large raptor-like bird  \nand most importantly nelo angelo vergil at  this point has no free will of his own and  \nacts according to mundus's commands he challenges  dante several times throughout his journey but he  \nwouldn't recognize that this was actually his  brother during their first bout nelo angelo  \ngets the upper hand but just when he's about  to finish him off dante's amulet slips into   his view which awakens the memories from his past  it causes him immense pain and he flees the scene  \ntheir second encounter resulted in dante simply  winning and nelo angelo forced to retreat  \nbut on their third and final encounter he  unleashed his full power for which dante gives   him a little respect but still not recognizing  him despite this dante yet again defeats nelo  \nangelo for the last time his corpse rises into  the air as he screams in pain and disappears  \nback to the demon world he drops his half of the  amulet which dante picks up and finally realizes  \nthat that was vergil all along with both halves  of the amulet restored and sparta's blade in hand  \nhis sword is restored to its true form seeing all  of his generals slain mundus has trish lure dante  \ninto a trap where he is forced to face a demon  referred to as nightmare it is a biological weapon  \nan amalgamation of varying demonic material with  the potential to consume all of the demon realm  \nit has the ability to pull you into an evil  dimension where you must face reflections   of trauma that rest in your subconscious dante is  successfully lured in and trish reveals herself to  \nbe on the side of mundus regardless the monster  is still defeated and in the aftermath of the  \nchaos the room begins to collapse seeing trish  about to get crushed dante rushes to her rescue  \nand saves her life it was an act that both  confused and moved her all the same not being  \nable to help but wonder why he would do something  like this he tells her about his mom and their   physical resemblance but being betrayed in this  manner hurt him in ways he'd never been used to  \nand lashes out at her with heated passion and love  towards his mother you may look like my mother  \nbut you know we're close to her you have no soul  you have the face but you'll never have her fire\ndespite dante's words trish was deeply moved by  his actions and actually won her over similarly  \ndante wasn't as hostile as he appeared part of him  still cared for her based on how she looked mundus  \nutilized this to his advantage and uses trish as  a hostage upon confronting mundus dante would yet  \nagain choose to value trish's life getting injured  as a result though in a surprise change of heart  \njust as mundus was about to deliver his  final blow trish pushes dante out of the way   taking the attack herself the sight of trish's  sacrifice only reminds him of the death of his  \nmother how powerless he was back then all of the  grief sorrow and anger all thanks to this one  \ndemon but this time around things are different  he's learned so much in his time as a demon hunter  \nhe's had to experience so many different hardships  all of his emotions are channeled into one immense  \npower that only could have come from the blood  of sparta mundus pulls him into a new dimension  \ngloating about how powerful he is and how he can  do anything like making as many mothers for dante  \nas he wanted similarly to how he made trish but  with a powerful belt of silence dante transforms  \ninto the form of sparta the grand battle commences  both from sky and on the ground with dante of  \ncourse emerging victorious even in victory the  feeling is bittersweet the loss of trish makes him  \nfeel guilty for not trying to fill her dark soul  with light in memoriam he leaves her both with his  \nmother's amulet as well as his father's sword but  as dante goes to leave the island he is yet again  \ninterrupted by mundus who was not killed and has  since shed his idealistic and angelic figure for  \nthe grotesque demon he always was no longer in the  demon world dante's powers are much more limited  \nthough in a surprise revival trish shows up  lending dante her power where the two are able  \nto push mundus away and seal him once more trish's  return isn't greatly expanded upon it's uncertain  \nif she was only gravely injured by mundus's  initial blast or if she was killed and brought  \nback to life many believe that she was killed but  thanks to the amulet and sword that dante gave her  \nit managed to resuscitate her anyway the reunion  of the two is chalk filled with emotion so much  \nso that trish even cries a sign to dante that a  devil has gained parts of humanity these tears  \ntears are a gift only humans have and  with that the two escape on a plane as  \nthe entire island collapses in on itself and  explodes in the aftermath of the event trish  \nthen begins working at dante's business  which he newly renamed devil never cry\nDevil May Cry Drama CD Vol.1\ntrish and dante would work together for a few  years both getting accustomed to each other's   day-to-day habits or more accurately getting fed  up with them largely on the side of trish with  \ndante's excessive consumption of pizza for every  meal but regardless of their dynamic the two would  \ndevelop a very meaningful relationship with one  another not one of romance but as described by   the creator of the franchise something much more  we aren't spent much time with them witnessing the  \njobs that they took on but probably the most  important job the two took on in their time   as partners was from dante's old broker enzo  you see despite working with him for so long  \nenzo had never come to bear witness or  even believe in demons in the first place   he and trish became acquainted with each other  in their time same goes for morrison as well  \nand so he came to them for a job to explore  some ancient ruins that were under construction  \nbeing a bit of a weasel that he is he was  looking to find some treasures amongst the rubble   and he needed capable lookouts as it would turn  out he did find what he was looking for dante  \nand trish were attacked by demons and enzo found  a devil arm he initially manages to convince the  \ntwo to keep it but upon further research by trish  she uncovers it was a gun created by machiavelli  \none of the underworld's greatest gunsmiths he  had created many notable weapons the artemis  \nthe pandora and even the angelo's armor when they  learnt this they immediately sought out enzo only  \nto find him trying to sell the gun the demonic  force within the firearm then possessed enzo's  \nhand seeking to take over its host and claim its  freedom to save his life dante severed his arm  \nand destroyed the gun enzo would survive and it  came to really open his eyes and he came to fully  \nbelieve in the existence of demons the whole thing  gave him a change of heart he wanted to contribute  \nand help out in his own way and so he opened a  devil arms pawn shop where he would house all of  \nthe various weapons dante had collected throughout  his journey and brought to him this also made  \ntrish realize how she could help out elsewhere as  well considering her vast knowledge of the demon  \nworld and the weapons crafted there she thought  she could help prevent instances like what enzo   went through on her own and so she decided to  leave devil never cry to pursue her own path  \nshe also asked dante to revert his business  name back to devil may cry which he did  \nDevil May Cry: The Animated Series\nand with that after a few years of partnership  dante was back to his own solo gigs and we reached  \nthe events of devil may cry the animated series  this 12 episode anime gives us more of an insight  \ninto dante's day-to-day jobs the lesser demons  he's hired to take care of to keep his bills paid  \nas such morrison would get some on-screen time  and we get to witness first hand what he does for  \ndante as his broker a lot of the series actually  isn't too important to the larger overall timeline  \nhe does things like stop a demon who  kills via racing competing in a life or   death game of poker and even connecting two  lovebirds in a romeo and juliet situation  \nif romeo was a demon episodes like that expand  on the concept of demons even further and their  \nability to feel human emotions like his father  and trish did there are a few episodes that span  \nthe series that are definitely worthy of note  in episode 8 once upon a time dante is tracked  \ndown by his old childhood friend ernest and  brought back to morris island ever since the  \nday he was run out of town ernest was adamant  in proving dante's innocence and that a demon  \nwas responsible for the attack his method of doing  so was by summoning the demon and killing it with  \na shotgun by this point it should be obvious that  that plan wasn't going to work in the slightest  \nbecause of his idiocy dante is forced to fight the  demon the aftermath of everything wouldn't be very  \npleasant ernest learns that the reason the demon  came to the town in the first place was because  \nof dante he blames him for everything the death of  the people the deception of him and the others he  \nwas close to not a single shred of sympathy  is thrown towards him and he never wants to  \nsee him again dante of course leaves feeling  sorrowful about the situation as they were  \nonce friends but while dante's past friendships  may have become lost new ones are formed perhaps  \nnot with him specifically but his friends become  friends by that i'm referring to lady and trish  \nin the episode rolling thunder we get to witness  the very first time the two meet and it's not  \nexactly a friendly first impression you see trish  had been working an area that had become infested  \nwith demons ever since a new priest arrived she'd  been going around killing all of the lesser ones   which certainly put him on the back foot he didn't  want to risk getting killed himself so he actually  \ngot a bit creative by pretending to be an innocent  and humble priest whose town was under attack by  \na ruthless demon he hired lady to kill trish it  was a ruse she outright fell for because trish is  \na demon at the end of the day the two would clash  on multiple occasions going all out with extreme  \nvigor and animosity largely on the side of lady  they even have a bit of a spat at a clothing store  \nbut don't fight because there are in fact innocent  people around but in truth the whole situation was  \nmade complicated thanks to trish the demons she  was hunting were fairly weak and she hadn't been  \ntested by a worthy opponent in quite a while upon  seeing lady she seemed like the type who could  \nreally give her a run for her money and so decided  to keep fighting her dante was generous enough to  \nkeep it a secret for a little while until it  seemed like things might go too far everything  \ngets revealed at the church putting lady in a not  so great mood for having been played the entire  \ntime they confront the priest and he has the oh so  unfortunate fate of facing the wrath of all trish  \nlady and dante together the episode ends with the  two hitting it off they've come to form a mutual  \nrespect for each other in their fighting ability  fashion sense and pleasure in messing with dante  \nbut in terms of the larger plot that comes in the  form of a nine-year-old orphan girl named patty  \nlowell in the first episode of the series dante  is hired to protect her as she was supposedly  \nthe heiress of a large family fortune she didn't  know that she had the reason she needs protecting  \nis because there are apparently demons who will  kill for just money dante protects paddy against  \nall of those attacking but by the end of the  episode we learn that she was just used as a decoy   another woman by the name of patty lowell found  a girl who had the exact same name and so pinned  \nall of the media and attention onto her so  she could safely arrive undisturbed dante  \nkills the demon seeking the money and feeling  remorseful for putting a young child in danger  \nthe older paddy offers to raise her paddy would  decline this offer instead choosing to stay with  \ndante at his office the older paddy does still  try to make amends by giving the young girl a  \nhealthy sum of the fortune which she used to spend  on clothes and donating the rest to the orphanage  \nshe grew up in throughout the series paddy would  be a constant character always providing color  \ncommentary against dante however the truth is she  would have a lot more relevance than initially  \nmet the eye she was actually a descendant of a  powerful alchemist and sorcerer named alan lowell  \nallen used to have the ability to summon demons  and bend them to his will they were obedient and  \ndid whatever he commanded but one demon was much  too powerful and could not be controlled he was  \nknown as abigail and while not quite as strong  as a demon king he had power that could rival it  \nseeing how dangerous the power was allen created  a nigh impenetrable barrier and sealed it away  \na pendant known as allen's tear was left behind  and was the key to gaining abigail's sealed power  \nas such it was highly sought after by many demons  fortunately the pendant had the power to ward off  \nmany lesser demons protecting its wearer the  amulet was passed down through the generations  \nand eventually made its way to paddy's biological  mother nina lowell she feared for her daughter's  \nsafety and so chose to put her up for adoption  when she was still a baby so she didn't have to   live in constant danger the villain throughout  the series is a lesser demon named sid hoping  \nto claim the powers of abigail for himself a lot  of the events in the anime and jobs dante goes  \non are manipulated by sid as to break abigail's  seal he needs a variety of items for a ritual  \nso things like dante going back to morris island  killing two apprentices of sparta and so on are  \nall part of his plan the specifics about what the  ritual needs and why specific items are needed  \naren't exactly specified so it comes off as a  bunch of random things when he begins nearing  \nall of the items required he eventually makes his  play at stealing alan's tear from nina lowell he  \nkills and possesses her close friend simon and  convinces her to hand the amulet over to dante for  \nsafe keeping the only reason i can imagine he did  this was because he needed another powerful demon  \ndead to use for the ritual he does make an attempt  at pickpocketing the amulet however is stopped due  \nto its ward not feeling comfortable not being  in possession of it nina intends on taking the  \namulet back but before she can sid kidnaps her  as the amulet is now the last item he needs  \nconsidering that her mother has appeared out  of nowhere and patty being confident that it's   her becomes a key player as well as seeking

his stupor and  lays waste to the demons running rampant nearby  \nbut the real problem is sid like many demons who  manage to attain such immense power he is given  \na false sense of unstoppable force it makes it  all the more intimidating to them when dante  \nsimply walks right through it he proclaims as he  has and would many times that the reason he has  \npower is due to his soul sid sacrificed everything  including his soul for the sake of power sid is  \ndefeated and having gone too far to simply forgive  dante puts a bullet through his head and jackpot\nin the end the world-ending demon was vanquished  and things returned to their natural place  \nnow reunited and not having to fear the threat  of being hunted paddy decides to move out of  \ndevil may cry and in

(novel)\ndante's next big adventure would come in the form  of a book in the devil may cry 2 light novel we  \nare introduced to a new character named beryl a  woman with red curly hair black bodysuit and armed  \nwith a heavy duty anti-tank rifle as with most new  additions her story introduces a whole plethora  \nof new lore her story goes when she was a young  girl her father tried to harness a demonic item  \nknown as the beast heads it was a demon created by  mundus which can take the form of either a statue  \nor an actual demon it can show that who touches  it the past present and future along with a lot of  \nother quirks while it bears a striking resemblance  to cerberus which dante has fought in the past  \nit's not actually related beryl's father tried to  use this item in hopes to bring his wife back from  \nthe dead however the power is much too dangerous  for the likes of humans as they're often driven  \ninsane upon contact it instead transformed him  into a demon as such he tried flying away with his  \ndaughter but was shot down in the process he also  stabbed her with the statue around her collar and  \nneck her wound eventually healed but she gained  the ability to sense the presence of the beast  \nheads when close her scar begins burning like  a game of hot and cold since then she's become  \na devil hunter seeking to one day put an end to  the beast heads the novel consists of her hiring  \ndante for his help and the two tracking it down  a lot of the story isn't too worthy of note the  \njourney is made especially difficult thanks to  an underworld crime syndicate run by a man named   chen who was interested in using the item when the  two actually encounter and fight the beast heads  \nit sucks them both into an alternate reality where  things get a bit silly and vary from history in  \nthis new dimension exists a world where mundus  had captured dante when he was still a child  \nvergil on the other hand still as the existence  of nelo angelo led a resistance against him with  \nhis lieutenants griffin and phantom without any of  his original allies mundus instead had an army of  \ntrishes at his command in this new reality dante  agrees to help fight against mundus once more  \nwhich he succeeds in and the two escape the  alternate reality the book ends with chen  \nabsorbing the beast heads for more power so  he can fight against dante but as per usual  \nthe devil hunter emerges victorious with barrel  putting one right between his eyes the beast heads  \nare destroyed and as thanks for helping her beryl  gives dante her weapon after this job it's unknown  \nwhat became of her months would pass and dante  presumes she just returned to a civilian life  \nsince her father was avenged and she no longer had  her gun but no one really knows for sure she is  \nhinted at much further down the timeline however  the woman shown bears almost no resemblance to  \nthe barrel depicted in the novel the book ends  months later when dante pondering about these  \nevents and his lack of jobs recently all of a  sudden gets a dagger thrown through his window  \nbearing an invitation to a museum and this leads  to the beginning of devil may cry 2. dante in both  \nDevil May Cry 2\nthe novel and the second game would now be 33. the  plot of devil may cry 2 revolves around arga sax  \nif you recall he was the demon who challenged  mundus for control of the demon world long ago  \nand wound up splitting its loyalties into two  sparta defeated both of them sealing them away  \nfor argus acts he used four sacred relics referred  to as the arcana if united under the solar eclipse  \na gate to the demon world will open and argusax  freed considering that took place centuries ago  \na group who was there to witness and even summon  sparta for his assistance against him was formed  \nto safeguard the island of v de marley this group  were known as the protectors in modern day an evil  \nbusinessman named aryas is seeking to become an  all-powerful immortal like arkham he too has an  \nobsession with the dark arts and has become a  modern day sorcerer he managed to get away with   it thanks to being hidden in plain sight he runs a  multi-million dollar corporation known as oroborus  \nknown for its mining and construction in  reality he used his business to buy up land  \nwhich housed ancient ruins and pillaged whatever  he could relating to demons and the underworld  \nhe even used his knowledge of arcane sciences  to create artificial demons which he refers to  \nas secretaries one secretary labelled kai was a  defect but before she could be disposed of one  \nof the protectors of veda marley matiere found her  and raised her as a daughter kai would be renamed  \nlucia and be raised to become a protector herself  unaware of what she truly was when aryas began  \ntargeting the island it became clear that the  protectors needed additional assistance from   elsewhere while dante may have started out a  bit undercover when he started all of these  \njobs he's accomplished have made him into a bit of  a legendary devil hunter so his identity amongst  \nthose who need to know is fairly well known now  because of this lucia was the one who gave him the  \ninvitation to come to the museum to put it nicely  nearly all of the events that happen in the game  \naren't too relevant or worthy of note dante meets  mattie and accepts her job throughout the game he  \nfights against demons lucille learns that she's  an artificial demon and has an existential crisis  \nand the four arcanas are collected to summon  argosax aryus absorbs some power which mutates  \nhim however he's killed by lucia dante travels  to the demon world and puts an end to argosax  \ndespite the claim that he would be trapped  in the demon world if he went there as would   later be described by dante a portal opened up  randomly cause that's prone to happening and he  \njust walked through allowing him to return to  the human world lucia would come to terms with   what she is and the story ends with her and dante  reuniting unlike the others dante's had a history  \nwith lucia simply returns back to vida marley  to continue being a protector alongside matier\nFortuna & The Order of the Sword\ndevil may cry 4 introduces a lot of new characters  and story considering that dante no longer becomes  \nthe main character as it instead focuses on nero  his life and where he grew up as vaguely touched  \nupon earlier in the timeline fortuna is a city  which worships sparta as a god as he benevolently  \nruled here long ago it was home to the largest and  most important hell gate connected to the demon  \nworld as such he used the yamato to seal it away  and prevent it from ever being used again lest  \nsomeone used the sword to reopen the seal long  after sparta disappeared they formed a religious  \norganization dubbed the order of the sword in  his name where they swore to eradicate all demons  \nfighting for the lives of mankind as he did so  long ago they are led by sanctus a former general  \nof the holy knights and a devout follower of  sparta he was so committed to his dream of  \nbringing the world to a paradise free of demons  that he even killed the former pope solemnists  \nabout 17 years prior to modern day he was next  in line to become pope however his dream of  \ninheriting that title was unlikely as it is  only passed on via the current pope's death  \nto avoid any suspicion he spent the next two years  of his life slowly poisoning solemnness until he  \ninevitably passed away no one suspected  anything and sanctus inherited the title  \nin fact his timing of receiving the title would  actually coincide with another visitor who came  \nto fortuna around this time vergil while exploring  the city vergil came across sanctus's room while  \nfollowing in the footsteps of sparta to see what  he left behind and the two exchanged conversation  \nthey didn't fight as sanctus while a warrior  could sense vergil's aura pinning him as some  \nsort of demon and or god who possessed great  power their conversation ends with vergil not  \nminding that they worship sparta but letting them  know that he will become more powerful one day  \nand who will they worship then sanctus would  remember this conversation and piece together  \nhimself that the man he just met must have been a  descendant of sparta anyway with sanctus in charge  \nthe order of the sword's ambitions and methods  became much more extreme thanks to a scientist  \nnamed agnes the man grew up in fortuna and thus  came to hold strongly the beliefs of those who  \nlive here have been accustomed to however he moved  away at some point and began working at uroboris  \naureus's company where he met a woman working  there named alyssa martin she is a faceless  \ncharacter who doesn't hold too much significance  but she is the half-sister of rock goldstein  \nnell goldstein's son who also worked at the  company somehow she and agnes wound up falling for  \neach other and they had a child whom they would  name nicoletta however when she was around two to  \nthree years old agnes got a summons from the pope  and immediately made his way back to fortuna alone  \neven though alyssa was willing to move there with  him and even adopt the religion she soon became   diagnosed with an incurable disease where she was  hospitalized and inevitably died a few years later  \nrock goldstein would then adopt nico and raise her  teaching her all about her family's histories most  \nnotably nell's work agnes contributions to the  order were practically invaluable he and sanctus  \nwere key to shaping its entire structure for a new  era the anti-demon weapons the knights don were  \ndesigned by agnes and feature a combustion engine  for powerful strikes he made various artificial  \ndemons by magically cross-breeding weapons with  animals his most common creations were the alto  \nand bianco angelos they are armor inhabited by  the soul of either a human or more often than not  \ndemon and act according to its master to get the  souls of demons agnes also created artificial hell  \ngates by copying the real one and powering them  via devil arms he could allow a small quantity of  \ndemons to pass through which he would then capture  and experiment on it was also he who invented the  \nsavior a giant statue-like demon created in the  image of sparta by melding together millennia of  \ndemonic matter and spirit it attained such immense  power but to control it it needs to absorb someone  \nwith sparta's blood and they also need his iconic  sword the savior was meant to be their weapon to  \nwipe out all of the demons but one of agnes's  greatest discoveries was the ascension ceremony  \nit was a magical ritual which he developed where  members could imbue themselves with demonic power  \nonly those who were strong enough in both mind and  body were able to survive the process and attain a  \nnewer demonic form those who fail wind up losing  their sanity and turn into unnatural false demons  \nand finally also procured was vergil's shattered  yamato after his defeat at the hands of mundus  \nthe broken blade somehow made its way back to the  human world and the order was able to obtain it  \nwith it they would be able to re-open the  true hell gate and kill all demons who come  \nthrough agnes worked diligently to try and make it  whole again but could never quite figure out how  \nNero\nnow we can finally get to the life of our main  character nero being the unexpected child between  \nthe relations of vergil during his visit and who  many assume was a prostitute at the time upon his  \nbirth nero was left at the doorstep of the city's  orphanage he was named nero by the workers there  \nbecause of the black blanket he was wrapped in  growing up his childhood wasn't very pleasant  \nhe was often bullied and made fun of by the  other kids for having a prostitute for a mother  \nconsidering that the town is relatively small and  everyone knew everyone when someone was expecting  \na baby people knew since no one gave birth to  him everyone assumed that he was a bastard child  \nbut not everything was doom and gloom for poor  nero there were those in fortuna who had a  \nmore gentle soul two siblings often visited the  orphanage to help out kyrie and credo they were  \nfaithful followers of their religion and believed  in helping those in need just like sparta did in  \nthe past they became particularly close to nero  thanks to their parents who took a unique liking  \nto him because of his rare white hair it reminded  them of their god unbeknownst to them and so he  \nbecame close to their family while a slightly  biased way to start off their relationship  \nit in no way had nefarious intentions they  treated him like family always praying for and  \nbelieving in him nero would even describe them  as the kindest people he ever knew unfortunately  \nthey later died at the hands of demons who  failed the ascension ritual credo was aware  \nof this fact as he had standing within the order  however refused to tell kyrie for obvious reasons  \nnero while he was never very religious to begin  with completely stopped believing in god after  \nthis event he figured that if he truly existed  he wouldn't have let such kind people who cared  \nfor him die fortunately he did still have a credo  and kyrie to lean on in fact credo would serve  \nas much of his mentor figure he admired not only  his kindness like the rest of his family but his  \nhonor sense of justice and his combat prowess it  was he who taught nero how to wield a blade and  \nin fact he's the reason nero decided to join the  order despite being an atheist he was inspired to  \nfollow in his footsteps as well as play a part in  protecting the city that kyrie loved so much nero  \nas you might expect had a rocky relationship with  the order his lone wolf mentality meant he wasn't  \nvery good at teamwork and he was looked down upon  for his use of guns the order believed in using a  \nblade just like sparta nero also heavily modified  his weapons because he felt like he was restricted  \nand they weren't powerful enough to take down  demons but possibly one of the most important   days that changed nero's life was the day his arm  changed on a completely normal and unsuspecting  \nevening everyone was going about their lives as  they normally would kyrie was taking the kids at  \nthe orphanage for a field trip through the forest  when they were suddenly attacked by demons three  \nknights were sent to help out but nero rushed  there of his own volition one of the knights   died trying to protect everyone and nero made a  desperate entrance and pleaded for kyrie to run\na multitude of different factors contributed to  nero partially activating his devil bringer his   deep-rooted desire to protect kyrie along with  sustaining an injury to his arm while fighting  \nagainst the demons whatever it was something  within him triggered his arm slowly began to  \nchange he initially believed it was some sort of  infection from the demon and so bane ditched it up  \nto keep it hidden but over time he slowly realized  by himself that whatever it was had power against  \ndemons so he began to train it in secrecy he  became proficient in its use and utilized it to  \nits fullest considering its demon-like appearance  no one was aware of nero's arm as he feared the  \nrepercussion and reaction those might have unlike  dante and vergil who have a devil trigger which  \nencompasses their entire body nero's is referred  to as a devil bringer as it is only partially  \npart of him another important detail to note  is needless to say amongst their history kyrie  \nand nero developed romantic feelings for  each other and eventually became a couple  \nDevil May Cry 4\nfast forward in time a bit and we changed  perspectives entirely all the way back to   lady nothing much has changed with her she's still  taking jobs hunting demons but during one of them  \nshe encountered an angelo which took her prey  one time was annoying but it happened several  \nmore times after and she didn't have a good  feeling about them she was able to tell that they   were demons but didn't know why a demon would be  collecting other demons as well as hunting devil  \narms she turned to an acquaintance of hers who's  a purveyor of artifacts where she drew the order  \nsymbol which she saw on the armor and he told her  about fortuna city much to her bewilderment she  \nlearned all about their religion and worshipping  of sparta seeing multiple red flags she decided to  \ntell a now 38 year old dante about it it didn't  seem like it was because she didn't think she  \ncould handle it but perhaps he might find it  interesting to learn more about his old man the   whole situation was very fascinating for everyone  involved trish was the first person to set forth  \nand arrive in the city as it seemed like she was  very interested in learning about these people   the role she played was more of reconnaissance  yes there were many red flags picked up by lady  \nhowever if the people were harmlessly worshipping  sparta then there was no real need to do anything  \nabout them but like any chain of command all of  the really shady details come from the top so  \ntrish needed a way to become an executive within  the holy nights and become a part of that inside  \ncircle quickly fortunately she just so happened  to possess one of the most important pieces  \nthe order was looking for to control the savior  sparta's blade to go unrecognized she completely  \nchanged her entire appearance to a dark-skinned  white-haired woman with an overtly sexual outfit  \nshe went under the alias gloria upon handing over  the sparta she was rewarded with an executive  \nposition which came much to the chagrin of the  others her rapid promotion made it so they barely   knew anything about her let alone if she could be  trusted and her clothing wasn't exactly very holy  \nright from the get-go she was walking on thin  ice around everyone but she was in a position   to receive otherwise classified information  which is really all she cared about lady  \nwould also be around in the events to come  despite the fact that nothing is ever seen   or detailed i just thought it would be important  to note that she is also in fortuna dante's  \narrival would be a bit more delayed than trish's  as she had to accrue all of this information and   relay it to him but eventually he came to learn  all about the hell gates the ascension ritual  \nthe savior everything and so dante made the  decision that the order had to be stopped\non one unsuspecting morning day a sermon was being  given to the people as it usually is kyrie was  \nperforming and in fact it was an important day  for her and nero as he intended on giving her   a necklace as a gift unfortunately nero got a  bit held up clearing out a group of demons in  \nthe streets however he is able to make it to the  tail end of her performance it's unfortunate as it  \nwas the only part of the sermon he was interested  in seeing he sticks around just long enough until  \nkyrie arrives and can claim her gift continuing to  be the cool and doesn't care type on the outside  \nbut just when he was getting ready to leave  dante comes crashing through the ceiling and   assassinates sanctus in front of everyone a  panic spreads throughout the church as dante  \ncontinues to battle against the demonic guards  being the supreme general of the holy knights  \ncredo is understandably concerned about his vicar  but that also made him a target for dante's blade  \nkirye makes a mad dash to protect him breaking  away from nero's grasp only to collide with some  \nbystanders landing completely vulnerable  on the floor when dante approaches her  \nunlikely that he was actually going to do anything  nero immediately steps in furious that she was put  \nin any sort of danger he decides to fight dante  himself he proves to be more than meets the eye  \nstanding toe to toe in combat but it'd be more  accurate to say dante's just playing with his food  \nwhat does surprise him is his demonic arm unlike  the typical devils that make up the portion of the  \nknights nero's bears a striking resemblance to a  devil trigger and on top of that the look in his  \neye while fighting reminds him of his brother  he leaves him with an ominous message saying  \nhow they're the same though it's a claim that  even he's not so sure about dante then heads off  \nto take care of the rest of the order dante would  go about his plan at his own pace as he instead  \nopts to take his time and have a look around the  city to learn more about the history of his father  \nbut with dante now in town it meant the order  could proceed with their plans they always wanted  \nhim to come to the city eventually as they needed  blood from a kin of sparta to power the savior  \nit's partially why the hell gates were constructed  in hopes to lure him in nero is one of the very  \nfew within the knights who was unaware of this  leaving him very confused over his relevance  \nnevertheless credo commands the capture of dante  which nero promises he'll do demons then break out  \nacross the city wreaking a havoc after ensuring  the safety of kyrie nero proceeds on his journey  \nto where dante was last seen headed on his path  nero encounters many of the demons guarding their  \nrespective hellgates he even crosses paths with  trish disguised as gloria of course it's their  \nfirst official time meeting so it's not an all  too eventful interaction both largely eyeing  \nand sizing up what the other is about before  parting ways behind the scenes things are going  \nsurprisingly well for the order as sanctus returns  to life through the ascension ceremony he was able  \nto be resuscitated from dante's assassination  but with new demonic vigor credo fills him in  \nthat he has his men as well as nero hunting  dante which comes much to the chagrin of agnes  \nas previously established nero doesn't have a very  positive reputation amongst the order due to his  \nrebellious nature it's only because of the history  he and credos share that he's been assigned such  \nan important role agnes's worries about him  were not without warrant he feared that he might  \nstumble upon his hidden research facility where  his more shady tests are performed and that's  \nexactly what happened nero throughout his journey  has become incredibly untrustworthy of the order  \nseeing them as demons encountering the hell gates  even getting attacked by the angelos everything  \nhad hinted that something very nefarious was going  on and finding agnes lab was the coup de grace  \nit was the same lab where the broken yamato was  being held and he has a run-in with agnes here  \npretty much all of the order's plans get revealed  to nero in a grand villain monologue as typically  \ngoes for villains who do this agnes is fully  expecting nero to die by the end of this so he can  \nperform tests and study his mysterious arm thus is  the reason he shoved his sword through his chest  \nin a very literal sense despite his demon blood  nero was dying his life flashed before his eyes  \nthe important moments throughout it and kyrie  it was all becoming lost to him but within  \nhis fading he was reminded of a dream he'd been  having more and more frequently in it there was  \na man he'd never met before staring at him with  a cold glare that had an odd touch of gentleness  \nhe asked nero if he could hear it the cry of a  soul he added by asking what his dying soul was  \ncrying for right now nero didn't respond to  his question instead relaying it back to him  \nthe man responded with power i want more power  hearing that nero replied he'll take that too  \nthe yamato close to him was resonating with his  soul the blood of sparta the blood of vergil who  \nwielded this sword before him nero used his devil  bringer restoring the yamato to its natural form  \nthe power was so intense that dante felt the  surge of energy from elsewhere in fortuna  \nthat it for a brief moment caused him to devil  trigger according to him it's only a reaction that  \ncan be caused by someone of the same blood origin  and to add on to that it felt extremely similar to  \nvergil's but dante knew his brother was no longer  around let alone in the human world so he became  \nextremely conscious of nero similarly to vergil  nero had an intense lust for power but unlike him  \nit wasn't a desire for himself it was so he could  protect those important to him it was perhaps  \nthat which made the difference into not turning  out like his father agnes was forced to retreat  \nleaving a now very upset nero in his wake pissed  off beyond belief nero figured he'd turn to one of  \nthe few people he actually trusted for answers  credo but before he did agnes returned to the  \ncouncil flustered in up in arms about nero even  accusing credo of being aware all this time that  \nhe was part demon a fact that he certainly did  not know sanctus would keep a cool head about the  \nsituation credo would be ordered to arrest nero  and gloria would volunteer to capture dante in  \ninstead but in reality trish had realized her time  undercover was drawing near and it was time to  \ncut the deception but probably the most important  revelation sanctus would have is nero's bloodline  \nhearing about his demonic arm as well as the fact  that he restored the yamato he figured nero must  \nbe the child of that mysterious man he met 19  years ago the timeline certainly added up and so  \nfigured he must have impregnated a woman back then  and nero was his offspring this completely changed  \neverything they no longer need dante to power the  savior if they can get their hands on nero and  \nunfortunately for him agnes overheard his cries  for kyrie the confrontation with credo would be  \nfilled with mixed emotions the two have obviously  formed a bond over their lifetime of experience  \nbut nero has begun to distrust the order and  credo has always had the utmost faith in them  \npair that with just learning about nero's demon  arm and witnessing credos's willingness to have   turned himself into a demon and you get a battle  not fought with logic rather emotion the duel ends  \nwith nero emerging victorious however foreseeing  his defeat agnes brought kyrie to their location to  \nwitness their fighting and see with her own two  eyes nero's arm she is understandably taken aback  \nby everything being thrown at her at once with  near all of it completely out of context for credo  \nusing his sister like this was crossing the line  he believed in just about everything the order   stood for but not this agnes would abduct kyrie  keeping her as a prisoner to continuously lure in  \nnero cradle would leave to find out the truth  behind the matter while nero was led into yet  \nanother trap sanctus while he was positive in his  assumption about nero's bloodline had to be sure  \nafter a duel with him in agnes there was  without a doubt that nero was a descendant\nis taken one more time but this time  directly to the savior where nero is   required on his path there nero yet again runs  into dante who this time was looking for him  \nhe caught word that the yamato had been restored  and nero was the man in possession of it so he  \ncame to take it back with all emotions running  high right now things don't go so simple instead  \nbreaking out into yet another fight amongst his  heated temper nero's devil bringer arm activates  \nand the yamato with it this was the exact  moment dante figured out he was vergil's kid  \nall of the other coincidental evidence hinted  to it but this was the confirmation once the  \nfight is over and nero has cooled off dante  makes a bold decision seeing nero's desire  \nfor how he intends to use the power  he lets him keep the sword and keep it\nnow that you're calm and cool get going trish  would also return to dante dropping the guise  \nof gloria nero's confrontation with sanctus  would not go in his favor using kyrie as a  \nhostage he easily subdues nero and extracts the  yamato from his arm cradle returns back into the  \nfray to try and stop sanctus as revenge for using  his sister however fails and is fatally wounded  \nnero is absorbed into the savior and it is left up  to dante and trish to clean up what's left behind  \nin his dying moments credo informs the  two about sanctus plain to release demons   and exterminate them all with the savior  before he leaves them with his dying request\ni'll do it agnes is given the yamato and with it  he is able to open the true hell gate unleashing  \nhavoc upon all of fortuna with that the order's  plans have come to fruition and it is up to dante  \nto stop it as has come to be expected of him  not much if anything truly stands in his way he  \ndestroys all three of the artificial hellgates and  the demons guarding them and he even has a poetry  \nslam against agnes despite all of his research  and attempts at harnessing the power of demons  \nhe is no match for the legendary devil hunter  uncertain as to what makes dante so strong  \nhe inquires for the sake of his research dante  hints that humans have something that demons  \ndon't before putting a bullet through his  research paper and then one through his head\nwith all obstacles out of his way dante ventures  into the bowels of the facility to retrieve the  \nyamato and close the hell gate to make sure it  is never used again he returns to the surface  \nand uses the blade to destroy the hell gate once  and for all all that was left was to take out the  \nsavior problem was it was fully powered exactly  as intended by using nero a blood of sparta as  \nits battery for a lack of a better term the  exterior was practically invincible it could  \nbe nicked and scratched but taking it down that  way would cause a whole lot of collateral damage  \nso he figured the only way he could take it out  was from the inside he pierced the yamato straight  \nthrough the savior's chest and right to nero this  would be the first glimpse we ever witness of the  \nyamato special trait the sword has the ability  to separate human from demon nero was literally  \nmelting away inside of the savior he was living  inside that black void but the sword allowed him  \nto break free of that and re-enter the human world  with sword now in hand and responsibility placed  \non his shoulders he went off to confront sanctus  once and for all similarly with the faults of  \nagnes sanctus's worshipping of sparta hails from  a misguided sense of power instead of trying to  \nemulate the type of person he was they were trying  to emulate the strength he possessed and it is  \nbecause nero embodies sparta's best qualities that  he is able to defeat sanctus and rescue kyrie  \nthe threat would not cease the savior  then assimilates sanctus and begins using   him as its battery becoming the false savior  it's nowhere nearly as strong as it once was  \nand is exceptionally slower and clumsier  making it easy work for nero to destroy  \nso no one else can ever use it again with that  fortuna's adventure's end kitty a is saved and  \ndante gets to say goodbye to his newly discovered  nephew while nero was initially worried about  \nkyrie's reaction to his demonic arm she completely  accepts everything about him just the way he is  \nkitty a if i'm a demon and not a  human anymore is this what you want  \nnero you're you and it's you i want to be with  i don't know anyone who is as human as you are  \nso\nlooks like they've determined i guess that kiss is gonna  have to wait that's all right\nPost DmC 4\nwith the events of devil may cry 4 in the past  nero and kyrie had a future ahead of them they  \nmoved into an apartment together but their lives  wouldn't change much with fortuna having suffered  \nmassive damage to its city kittier busies herself  with helping those who've lost their homes and  \nprepares food for them via a soup kitchen with the  nature of who she is and what she does she didn't  \nmake any money nor accept it when those offered  she was usually paid in food or other essential  \nitems that led to the monetary side of living up  to nero fortunately having met dante he's learnt  \nthat demon hunting can be a business so he and  kyrie opened up their own devil may cry branch  \nin fortuna dante was even generous enough to  donate a blue neon sign with the business's name  \nand on top of everything they're already doing  the two took in three orphans julio kyle and carlo  \nthe orphanage where they grew up was destroyed  so they took them in and take care of them  \nthe incident also attracted many reporters  and novelists investigating the city nero  \nhad convinced everyone to keep quiet about what  happened as it was quite ridiculous of a story  \nas such he was the only one who spoke to them  but the only thing he told them is how there  \nwas nothing interesting there and to leave it  was reported on in the occult times magazine by  \nan author named jeffrey turner he wrote about the  savior's attack on the city the order of the sword  \neverything he was able to research without  actually being there which he surprisingly   got a lot right he was very passionate about  the article however it was so outlandish and  \nunbelievable to the general public it left a  serious stain on his journalistic integrity  \nsince then he's considered it nothing but a failed  article but still believes wholly in what he wrote   all of the events just detailed as well as about  to be take place within a time frame of 5 years  \nNicoletta Goldstein\nmost in the latter half in the prequel novel  devil may cry 5 before the nightmare we follow  \na whole plethora of differing perspectives and  paths that all wind up conjoining to one location  \none of the characters perspectives we  follow is that of nicoletta goldstein   to recap she was agnes's daughter who when he  left to rejoin the order left behind his sick  \nwife who died of an incurable disease since then  nico's completely hated him and was adopted by  \nrock goldstein her uncle and was raised with  an interest in engineering and gun making  \nin fact it was inadvertently dante who inspired  her you see all of this time he's been wielding  \nhis iconic pistols with a misspelling on them nell  engraved them with 45 art works in honor of her  \nson who misspelled it when he was a kid since  time has passed and her son rock has grown up  \ntrying to honor his mother dante came to his shop  one day with ebony and ivory asking that he fixed  \nthe mistake it only seemed right that since he  was the reason it was wrong to begin with he   should be the person to correct it rock would have  no idea who dante was or why he had the pistols  \nbut he was able to deduce the type of character  he was based on the wear and tear of the weapons  \nwhich he also recognized as his mother's work the  weapon's spelling would be fixed and rock would  \ntake a picture to commemorate nell's masterpiece  it was that picture nico found which completely  \nsent her head over heels the craftsmanship design  material she was so infatuated with everything she  \nso naturally fell into the field of engineering  and gun making rock taught her everything that he  \ncould she became good but nowhere near as good as  she wanted she even decided to stop making pistols  \nas she knew she could never surpass the work of  nell so to further her experience she turned to an  \nunlikely source agnes she did not like him had no  warm feelings for him whatsoever but she couldn't  \ndeny his genius he gave up literally everything  in favor of research the problem was nico had been  \nreading articles about fortuna and they detailed  the disappearance of the order despite running the  \nentire city after the incident they disappeared  into thin air she didn't know if this was  \ntrue however any information she was getting was  from occult magazines and they had a tendency to  \nlie just to spice stories up so she arranged a  meeting with the author of the article jeffrey  \nturner to speak with him face to face he more or  less confirms everything we already know about  \nthe incident while at the same time not really  knowing anything but he does tell her about the  \none person who was willing to speak who claimed  to be a knight in the order nero with that nico  \nset forth to fortuna with only a name to guide  her by pure trial and error asking every single  \nperson if they were or knew someone named nero she  came across julio the orphan he was taking care of  \nwhile good parenting on their end teaching him  not to speak to strangers he found her specific  \nasking for him by name curious so he led her  to their home where nero is working on fixing  \nhis weapons while he initially believes it may  be gloria based on the dark skinned description  \nhe instead is met with a complete stranger an  immediate red flag as strangers aren't supposed  \nto know what went on so it understandably puts  him on edge the two mix about as well as oil and  \nwater nero hates her incessant smoking and rude  attitude and nico hates that he lectures her like  \na child regardless she immediately cuts to brass  tacks and asks that he help her find the order's  \nresearch documents lost in the mayhem while he can  see that she doesn't seem to have any ill intent  \nthe fact that he doesn't really know her  and not knowing what she wants them for   is too much of a risk and so denies her request  it's not until she drops a completely out of the  \nblue question that really grabs his attention  and that's what happened to agnes he immediately  \nanswers saying that he's dead to which nico  simply scoffs when asked how she knew him  \nshe informs him that he was her father despite  dropping that heavy statement nico yet again  \ncompletely changes topics on a dime and shifts  her attention to nero's red queen which he can't  \nquite seem to get fixed being completely obsessive  and nerdy over this stuff she almost immediately  \nidentifies what's wrong with it and fixes it for  him better than it ever was being the good guy he  \nis nero now feels indebted to her and so agrees  to help her find her father's research the two  \nventure into fortuna castle where agnes's old lab  was located and find pretty much everything nero  \nwas still uncertain about her at this time and  intended on shooting her if she showed any signs  \nof using the documents for malicious intent but  the opportunity never presented itself instead  \nthe topic of guns did get brought up and she even  inspected blue rose she began speaking all about  \nnell's work and her handiwork which nero had very  little interest in that is until she brought up  \nebony and ivory he immediately made the connection  between her and dante because of his connection  \nto him it makes him feel like he's in an awkward  position he completely stands by dante in what he  \ndid as he's an important person to him and agnes  was a terrible human being who kidnapped kyrie  \nbut at the same time it's still her dad  nero explains this whole situation to nico  \nand she doesn't care at all she still doesn't  like her father but that doesn't seem to  \nchange nero's conscience from this point on  their relationship would shift to friendship  \nstill a rocky friendship where they're fed up with  each other but a friendship nonetheless nero and  \nkyrie would allow nico to stay at their home as  she studied agnes's research to earn her keep nico  \ndecided to become business partners with nero and  make weapons for his devil may cry branch for now  \nlet's put their story on hold as the events to  come snowball into a much larger series of events  \nDante Returns to Vie de Marli\nwhile not nearly as important of a detour to the  main narrative dante would pay a visit to the  \nisland of vie de marlie once more ten years after  defeating argosax he is once again requested by  \nmatije to help out with a new demon named balrog  balrog served as argosax's right-hand mind and has  \nall of a sudden appeared on the island but mattie  doesn't believe lucia can take him all by herself  \nthe pair are once again reunited and fight their  way to the powerful demon even despite all these  \nyears and lucia training to become stronger  dante is still dante and is more than capable of  \nhandling a situation like this alone he sees that  balrog possesses a shard of the broken yamato as  \nnot every piece was collected by the order which  is likely how he entered the human world to begin   with to counter his fiery flames of hell he uses  his trusty cerberus to shatter the yamato fragment  \nbut it results in cerberus breaking as well the  battle comes to an abrupt end when balrog realizes  \nwho dante is and he stands no chance against him  he willingly turns into a devil arm hoping to one  \nday be strong enough for a rematch just like that  dante seems to have suddenly re-entered lucia's  \nlife only to leave it just as quickly she realizes  that she has romantic feelings for him but as  \ndante does he offers to come back if more demons  should appear giving the idea that he's oblivious  \nto the feelings others have for him and with that  he leaves the island and returns back to his shop  \nVergil Returns\nreturning to the life of nero about one year has  passed since nico came to fortuna and has been  \nliving with them considering their circumstance  financially devils have been appearing less and  \nless in fortuna so he and kitty thought that it  might be a wise idea to take their demon hunting  \nbusiness mobile if he could travel out of town it  would expand his job reach exponentially meaning  \nthat they could better provide for their family  it was agreed upon and so both he and nico began  \nworking on fixing up an old van so they could get  to work but on one unsuspecting evening something  \ncompletely unexpected would occur and that was the  reappearance of vergil why do i feel like your pet  \nmechanic don't get used to it nico i showed you  those ordered ducks so you still owe me remember  \nhey youtube dinner's ready be right there hey  why don't you go ahead i'm gonna finish up here\ni'll try to save you some not\nyou uh you need something\nwhat is it you hungry well you're  in luck pal kids food's ready  \nkitty always makes too much i hope you like loud  talkers too because got a pair of those upstairs\nyou see something you like what the hell\nyou a demon\ni'm taking this back\ni'm running out of time\nnero was left bleeding profusely on the garage  floor as kitty and nico watched the mysterious  \nhooded figure teleport away an ambulance was  immediately called and for the next few weeks  \nnero would remain in a coma vergil had returned  to the human world it'd been over 20 years since  \nBirth of V & Urizen\nhe last lost to mundus and had been tortured and  controlled under his influence but as time had  \npassed he eventually managed to free himself from  both him and the demon world but it did not come  \nwithout a cost his body was weak crumbling before  his very eyes he was struggling to hold on to his  \nown life let alone power if he ever wanted to  defeat dante and attain the strength that he so  \ndesired he needed to get rid of what he thought  made him weak his humanity while he was strong  \nenough to rip the yamato from the arm of nero  afterwards he returned to his family home in red  \ngrave city where everything began using the power  of the yamato and its ability to separate man  \nfrom demon he plunged his sword through his chest  forcing two halves of the same man to be created  \none was the purely demonic half of vergil's soul  the embodiment of his lust for power completely  \nand utterly heartless and cruel the other  his repressed and disdained human half  \nas perceived he was very weak even by human  standards but these two weren't the only thing  \npurged from vergil's body also pushed out were  four physical manifestations of the trauma he  \nendured when he was nelo angelo they each take  the form of mundus's minions during that time  \ngriffin shadow nightmare and phantom as the  trauma and humanity were holding him back  \nthey were purged from his body feeling completely  powerless in the midst of such demonic power  \nhe didn't want to die after finding his childhood  book of poems on the floor it reminded him of his  \nhappier past sensing his desire to live the most  intelligent of the nightmare's griffin swooped in  \nand saved his life dragging him outside this  half of vergil would adopt the name v as his  \nown as it was written on his book long ago poetry  would be his most defining human characteristic  \nas such it is at the forefront of his personality  as he recites it often considering how pushed  \ndown this side of him used to be v is much more in  touch with his emotions and introspective over his  \npast self and actions he's able to understand what  went wrong for vergil especially in his outlook  \ntowards humans v respects them and believes their  tenacity to never give up is their best quality  \nhe's a calm and quiet individual but still very  pragmatic due to the fragility of his existence  \nand most importantly he's retained all of  the information of the past unlike his demon  \nhalf the two are not without their similarities  however they both share in their desire for power  \nhowever v's is a bit more nuanced without his  demonic power he's a fading entity a fact that  \nhe's fully aware of he wants to rejoin his other  half and stay alive all to become whole once more  \nbut it's obvious that he wants no part of who v  is the only way he can become a whole once more  \nis to defeat his other half and forcefully take  it something that alone he cannot accomplish  \nspeaking of his other half it should be important  to detail his plans as he would later be nicknamed  \nurizen his plan for power was by consuming  the qliphoth fruit the same fruit mundus used  \nto conquer the demon world enough time had passed  since its last use that a new one could be grown  \nstill in possession of the yamato he slices open a  hole to the demon world allowing the tree to grow  \ninto the human world due to its suspicious nature  the people of redgrave city would only monitor  \nthe strange anomaly until the tree became ready to  nourish itself with human blood for the time being  \nurizen claimed the empty throne in the demon  world and simply waited for the tree to grow  \nVisions of V\nupon being saved by griffin after his birth he  explains to v that he too is a dying entity the  \nfour familiars expelled from vergil require a  host to continue living so he figured since v  \nlacks the strength to defeat his other half  himself that by forming a contract with him  \nthey'll work together lest they risk dying while  initially unswayed by griffin's pitch the bird  \nis forced to prove himself after stealing the  clothes off of a punk who is robbing an old man  \ngriffin showcases his combat prowess by subduing  an impusa considering eurozen's new found birth  \nand power demons are beginning to appear more and  more putting redgrave city in grave danger much  \nto the shock of both griffin and v the impusa that  he attacked wasn't killed while the two bicker and  \ngriffin attempts to take it down once more he runs  out of demonic power leaving v to fend for himself  \nhe reflects on his weakness and how frustrating  it is to sit on the sidelines and so instead  \ndecides to fight he breaks into an old antique  shop nearby and steals a cane while griffin  \nrespawns and distracts the demon v stabs it  dealing a killing blow while the two are initially  \nbaffled over what transpired we learned that since  griffin and the others are simply nightmares they  \nlack the ability to actually kill anything like  a dream they can cause damage but they'll never  \noutright kill you for that reason v must be the  one who delivers the final blow as for his cane  \nit's actually nothing special it was theorized  that it was crafted by accident with small amounts  \nof demonic material like him the kane is also very  weak in demonic power it helps work as a conduit  \nto assist in killing demons after this incident  v formed a contract with griffin and attached to  \nhim via tattoos despite their allegiance they were  still very weak collectively so griffin urged him  \nto seek out the other three nightmares and forge  packs they can join willingly like he just did but  \nv is also able to force a pact if need be during  this conversation they are attacked by shadow he  \nsteals v's kane sensing its demonic power thinking  it can somehow get back to the demon world with it  \nit runs off and the pair give chase but when  they follow it into an alley they see it's been  \nattacked and is on the verge of death the culprit  was phantom the third nightmare he is excessively  \nhostile and has no intentions of serving someone  as weak as v as such he goes on the offense  \ntrying to kill them all now the two are forced  to think of a strategy on the fly they can't deal  \nwith both phantom and shadow attacking them so  griffin suggests just forcing a pact with shadow  \nright here and now v doesn't get time to think  about it as shadow recovers and is pretty pissed  \nin a moment completely devoid of all logic v  drops his defenses entirely to plead with shadow  \nif he wants to obediently die or struggle to live  if it's the latter then he needs him the message  \ngets through to him and the three decide to  team up and fight phantom they expose his core  \nand destroy him while outright killing phantom  comes much to the chagrin of griffin as he feels  \nhis powers were needed v says how he wouldn't  have cooperated anyway at the very least they  \ndid gain a new ally but lacking a true powerhouse  within the group v asked if there were any other  \nnightmares still around to which griffin  sheepishly said there was one the nightmare  \nbased on the abomination engineered by mundus v  was advised to steer clear of this monstrosity  \nbut he was determined that he would need its  power to rival eurozen they made their way  \nto an old church where it was located and it  quickly gave v's confidence a reality check  \nafter almost instantaneously one-shotting  both griffin and shadow it absorbed him into  \na nightmare it showed him and tortured him with  everything mundus trish nelo angelo and even  \ndante killing him v was forced to experience  and live through all of this again but he felt  \ninsulted by these illusions like they were trying  to say that he would never be as good as dante  \nhe used his anger and channeled his demonic energy  forcing his way straight through to the core of  \nnightmare crumbling it beneath his feet he still  did not force nightmare to become an ally nor did  \nhe waver when it retaliated and impaled him what  he did was take its core and bestow it upon him  \nhe takes ownership of nightmare as they in fact  always belong to him the message resonated with  \nthe monster and it formed a contract giving v his  three familiars after commanding all three of them  \nat the same time to wipe out the ensuing demons it  took a toll on his body and caused him to collapse  \nwhile the demons were all taken care of v was  forced to reflect on the limitations of his powers  \nwhile he believed nightmare was powerful enough to  perhaps defeat jurasian his inability to sustain  \nhim longer than a few seconds renders everything  pointless and considering there are no more  \nfamiliars to form contracts with it meant v was  at a dead end after reflecting further on his  \nlife and the reasons vergil lost to his brother  it sparked the idea to simply recruit dante  \nas he was the most sure-fire solution of defeating  urizen it was important to v that he remained as  \nanonymous as possible meaning he didn't want to  accidentally raise any red flags that might draw  \nsuspicion towards him this meant going through  the correct channels while he was fully aware  \nof where dante's shop was located most jobs come  through morrison so to blend in with the crowd  \nit was important to find the broker but before  that a little detour does ensue you can't hire  \nsomeone for a job without any money the way v and  the others wind up making it is through stealing  \nfrom other robbers the first time he does so he's  witness to a woman being robbed by three thugs  \nwhen they demand she hand over her necklace she  begs to keep it as it's a memento of her mother  \nthis reminds him of when eva gave him her half  of the amulet prompting him to help out but crash  \nlanding into some trash the robbers obviously  turned their attention towards him as well   but he had nothing to give them despite their  demands after being assaulted by one of them  \nshadow gets pissed and skewers all three of  them though non-lethally from here v loots  \ntheir money and leaves the woman's necklace behind  stating it holds no value while the woman would  \nbe traumatized by what she just witnessed  it showcases v's moral compass and the fact  \nthat he does have one and this would be how they  accrued their revenue after going on wild goose  \nchases trying to track down morrison but failing  to find him time and time again vee was badgered  \nby many thieves along the way due to his fragile  appearance but eventually one of their leads  \nwas tagru's cellar formerly known as bobby's  cellar it was the dive bar that dante and the  \nother mercenaries frequented when he was still  going under the name tony redgrave if you recall  \ngru was dante's old partner who was killed since  then his remaining daughters took ownership and  \nrenamed it after their late father morrison and a  woman named sally had been watching over the girls  \nand after 10 years morrison decided to visit  the bar for the first time we get a little bit  \nof banter showing how dante is still not a very  liked figure around there because of the tragedy  \nbut the daughters defend him saying how he's been  sending money over the years it is then when v  \nwalks in and finally finds morrison dropping a  bloody stack of cash and explaining the gist of  \nthe situation and the severity of it morrison  agrees to introduce v to dante he's led to the  \ndevil may cry and as he waits outside for his  introduction griffin brings up a few things  \nfirstly is whether or not dante might recognize  him v's not too concerned as he physically bears  \nno resemblance but he was encouraged to act  differently from vergil suggesting that he break  \nthe ice by telling a joke the other is what he  would do if dante couldn't win an idea that never  \ncrossed his mind it did force him to think about  nero for a split second who when last he saw him  \nwas lying on the floor bleeding out though he  thought he was too weak and dante was still the   safer bet and with that morrison made his  way into the shop to speak about his new  \njob opportunity also it's patty's 18th birthday  coming up since it's been 10 years since the anime  \njust thought i'd bring that up as it's relevant to  the scene you could have at least knocked morrison\nyeah i could have\ni got some good news and some bad news pick  your poison which you want to hear first\njust speak bad news it is\nlady patty's feathers are all ruffled see she   wants to invite you to her birthday  party but your phone is disconnected  \nyou're a smart one morrison you notice the  electric and water out too i expected nothing less\nso what's the good news oh i got  a gig cash up front cash up front  \nthis i like the water needs turning  on and those toilets need flushing\nwater gas and power coming out

trish bring  him in on this what come on you don't think  \ni can handle this gig on my own it's a big  job big job dante you're gonna need the help\nso what's your name\ni have no name i am the two days old\njust kidding you can call me v okay v why  don't you tell me everything about this job  \na powerful demon is about to  resurrect and we need your help dante\nnow that's a familiar tune do you have any idea  how many times i've heard that exact same line  \nthis is special special okay so what's so  special about this one this demon is your reason  \nyour reason for fighting this demon got a name\nv utters the name of his brother vergil  it shocked dante into a stunned silence  \nbut it quickly turned into a  furious rage as his demonic aura   overwhelmed the room part of him thought v was  toying with him and making the whole thing up  \nbut after he brings up how it doesn't matter  if he believes him or not because he'll see   when redgrave city is demonized and to pay  attention to the news that gives weight to  \nhis words dante chooses to believe him and  v is delighted by his intense reactions  \nto prevent the others from finding out  about vergil v insists on using an alias  \nthis is where urizen would get his nickname as he  said he would morrison set off to find both trish  \nand lady both of them expressed their beliefs that  dante can handle the job alone but are convinced  \nto help out for separate reasons trish decides  to join out of spite after morrison said dante  \ndidn't need her help and lady is fascinated about  his connection to red grave city as she recalls  \nseeing red grave engraved on his guns and with  that morrison escorted v dante trish and lady  \nvia helicopter to the qliphoth tree to defeat  urizen upon taking mere steps into the qliphoth  \nv realized he completely underestimated his power  he felt urizen's aura coarse throughout his  \nentire body it was vastly more powerful than when  they initially separated just a touch made it feel  \nlike his heart was being erased leaving him to  feel like he definitely needed an insurance policy  \nthis is far worse than i thought there's no  crime in turn and tail v these things might  \nbe a little too much for you you're right i'll  leave the rest to you what what what whoa my knife  \nall the way down here and turn into really  must always have an insurance policy  \nwho was that guy i can't believe he just ran no  one special come on let's go clean up this garbage\nfirst come first serve on the targets  right music to my ears hurry up dante\nguess i get to see it with my own eyes if it  really is you as dante trish and lady made their  \nway through the cliff v returned to morrison and  asked that he'd be immediately flown to fortuna  \nhe complies and after arriving v jumps out of  the helicopter and descends towards the hospital  \nnero is currently being monitored at he has an  immediate reaction to his presence and while v  \ntries to put him at ease nero isn't so sure about  him being short on time v cuts right to the chase  \nhe tells him that he knows the demon who stole  his arm and that dante is fighting him right now   but won't be able to win alone while nero has a  similar reaction to trish and lady thinking it's  \nnearly impossible for dante to lose v loses his  patience and switches tactics deciding to just  \nprovoke him he claims that he's not confident  without the aid of his devil bring her arm   something that nero takes great offense  too but regardless successfully recruits  \nhim the two return to his garage where he  stealthfully takes his red queen and blue  \nrose so kyrie won't hear him he knows she would  object to this mission but he's determined to  \ntake his revenge and re-obtain the yamato as he  feels he's failed dante who entrusted it to him  \nand so the two set out for the qliphoth while v  was busy dante had finally come face to face  \nwith jurasen trish and lady engaged him in battle  earlier however were overwhelmed by his power  \nand defeated a feat that impresses dante as  they don't go down so easily still uncertain  \nthat this is in fact his brother he tests him  with a single word only the two would understand\nand just like that he confirmed his brother's  identity and immediately went all out they  \nfought for hours while v was gone with  dante making very little if any headway  \nwhen the pair eventually arrived they quickly made  their way to eurizon's throne to help out while  \nthe morale of the whole situation is relatively  optimistic on our character's side it quickly gets  \nput into check when nero arrives to face urizen  himself v took off on his own path believing that  \nhe could take his time and when he arrived the  fight would be over and he could rejoin urizen   as an exhausted dante gets thrown to the side  nero tries his hand at facing the new demon king  \nhis one arm proves to be a much bigger hindrance  than anticipated resulting in him getting bloody  \nand battered and tossed to the side v arrives to  see that the battle has not only not been resolved  \nbut both dante and nero have failed to even lay  a scratch on him dante gets back up for round two  \nthis time utilizing his devil trigger but  recognizing the power urizen holds urges nero  \nand v to escape v heeds his advice and pulls nero  away seeing him as the only option if dante fails  \nbut he needs to become stronger while  dante tries yet again to face his brother  \nhis power is so immense that he is even capable of  completely shattering the rebellion to pieces as  \nhe went to consume his brother and turn him into  one of his puppets trish threw sparta's blade to  \ndante allowing him to harness its power to fight  back while vergil once vied for its power long ago  \nhe has since come to see no further use for it  believing to have surpassed its strength and so  \nblasts dante and the blade out of the clifot dante  would remain in a coma for the foreseeable future  \nwith dante gone urizen takes both lady and  trish and turns them into his minions lady  \nwould be trapped inside of artemis and trish would  become the cavalier angelo as for nero they  \nreturn to morrison informing him that they've  failed however all hope is not lost yet the  \nqliphoth still needs to grow and they have about  one month until the tree reaches full maturity  \nuntil then nero needs to become stronger without  dante he is their only hope to do so he would have  \nto return back to fortuna and figure out how  to compensate for his lack of an arm v would   cleverly disguise his actions by saying that he'll  stay in town to collect intel on the situation  \nbut of course he knows everything already and what  he really wanted to do was limit his movements to  \nslow his decaying process and from here the two  set off on separate pads promising to meet again  \nin one month's time as dated nero returned back  to fortuna and whilst having suffered a loss  \n1 Month of Preparations\nthe upside is that he returned to his family  alive facing urizen definitely made him realize  \nthat he needed to be firing on all cylinders to  the best of his ability while he was comfortable  \nfighting one-handed from his time in hiding  his devil bringer from kitty and the others   he needed both hands in the action for someone of  yarizen's caliber so he asked nico to make him a  \nprosthetic arm something she was already ahead of  him on as she'd been planning something like that  \never since what happened with vergil but she would  need six months to create it time they don't have  \nresponsibility then shifts onto her shoulders as  she's pressured to figure out a way to speed up   production the idea would happen a few days  later when nero is told about a blitz demon  \nin the forest doing what he does he set out to  kill it but this time brings nico along to get  \na first person perspective of the type of job  demon hunting is to make their journey short  \nnico has a revelation some demons come with an  organic and natural magical quirk if she could  \nsomehow study and use the demons parts she doesn't  have to make everything from scratch the organic  \nmaterial makes up a large bulk of what the arm  can do so all she has to do is slightly modify  \nits design to best complement the quirk so she had  nero scavenge the corpse of the blitz demon so she  \ncould understand how it harnessed electricity  and she got to work on designing a new arm  \nv's time within the month would be a lot more  introspective there's not much he can do about  \nthe qliphoth he has no standing with politicians  and they're likely not gonna heed his advice if   he gave it to them anyway so he left the people to  fend for themselves and figure out that the tree  \nis trying to kill them along with all of the other  demons but upon seeing a group of humans attacked  \nby demons he realizes the biggest difference that  separated dante and vergil were their ideals on  \nhumanity vergil always looked down on them and  their qualities but dante saw them as equals he  \nembraced his humanity and all of the qualities  that came with it it was perhaps that which made  \nit impossible for vergil to ever best his brother  so v was determined to course correct he decided  \nduring his time in red grave city to help out as  many people as he could even if it was just one  \nless person that cliff consumed buying them mere  seconds it would be worth it but it wasn't just  \nhis outlook towards others that changed he was  forced to look at himself as well after entering  \nan old grocery store for food he comes across  a distraught young boy being attacked by demons  \nafter saving his life he tells the child to leave  however the boy refuses as his unconscious mother  \nis stuck underneath a fallen shelf v belittles  the kid for being weak and that by not valuing  \nhis own life it'll only get him killed the child  begs for his help only for v to write him off  \nas disgraceful before beginning to leave him to  the surrounding demons but in a surprising turn  \nof events the child asks v if there is anything  wrong with asking for help for which it reminds  \nhim of mundus's attack on the mansion where he  was left alone asking for help he concedes that  \nbegging isn't shameful and uses nightmare to wipe  out all of the demons and save the mother and son  \nv reflects on having to ask for help and that  he right now has been relying on the help of  \nhis familiars in his goal it's a scary position to  be in with how fragile he is to rely on others but  \nthat fear is what vergil always failed to embrace  he always sought to compensate for anything he  \nlacked in raw power but that was never the right  answer v understands how he embodies vergil's fear  \nand weakness and so chooses to face the memories  of his past in order to become truly strong\nDevil May Cry 5\nas stated one month would pass before v and  nero returned to red grave city to rendezvous   and we reached the events of devil may cry 5.\nas intended nico successfully crafted nero  a prosthetic arm however it wasn't perfect  \nthere was so much energy compacted in such a  small area it made them susceptible to breaking  \nas such she dubbed them devil breakers due to  their design to break devils but also because  \nof their knack for breaking she and nero left  fortuna for red grave city and while nico tags  \nalong to ensure nero's arm is always in stock  as well as to get new inspiration along the way  \nfor nero this journey is more than just saving  dante and the world for him it's a battle of  \npride after one spectacularly stylish entrance  nero makes his way through the war-torn city  \nthat was once redgrave he and v agreed to meet  up at the local cathedral but when nero shows up  \nhe's met with a giant demon named goliath with  his devil bringer he showcases just how much  \nstronger he's become as v watches this all in the  distance when the battle nears its end that's when  \nhe decides to come down and finish the demon off  himself he explains all he needs to taniro about  \nthe qliphoth what it does and how to take it down  for now they need to clear some of the roots that  \nare in their way from making it down to the base  of the tree point is he says their destination is  \nat the bottom whether or not they meet up again  before then is irrelevant v takes his leave and  \nthe two set off on different paths to the same  goal both characters would come into contact  \nwith urizen's generals more specifically lady and  trish nero's fight against artemis and subsequent  \nrescuing of lady is purely coincidental in fact  he doesn't even know who she is despite her  \nbeing around in devil may cry 4. it's nico  who recognizes her from her gunsmith days  \nso they take her in and wait for her to recover  meanwhile v has a run-in with cavalier angelo  \nwho he overhears is being ordered to find  sparta's blade after confronting the demon he  \nsenses trish trapped inside and becomes determined  to save her i see i know what you are don't worry  \ni'll be gentle in a way to him it'd be a chance  at redemption since he could do nothing to save  \neva in the past he wants a chance to be able  to do something this time but while the steed  \nis defeated cavalier makes his escape while v  attempts to pursue his ptsd with nelo angelo  \ntriggers and he collapses allowing the demon  to get away he and nero would rendezvous once  \nmore after taking down gilgamesh lady reawakens  and tells everyone about how they were captured  \nand what transpired with dante v chooses not to  overstay his welcome instead pushing forward on  \ntheir journey with nero on their path they are  interrupted by more angelos but this time they  \nbear a near uncanny resemblance to v's past  he channels his trauma and pain into anger  \nand alongside nero the two wipe them all out with  only proto-angelo left v takes the opportunity to  \nput his past behind him envisioning the demon as  nelo angelo he proclaims that he is no longer  \nhaunted by him choosing to move forward free from  his nightmares following the fight they land where  \nhis and dante's childhood home used to be after  cryptically sharing his childhood memories of  \nbeing on the playground he once again decides  to part ways nero is to continue making his way  \nthrough the qliphoth while v searches for sparta's  blade as he feels they might need its power  \nsensing its aura he followed its path and much  to his approval it led them straight to it  \nunfortunately he is not strong enough in both mind  and body to wield the sword but there is always a  \nsilver lining as it is where the sparta landed the  same went for dante his comatose body was nearby  \nand it's thanks to the sparta that it concealed  his presence leaving him protected all this time  \nit's a fact that truly does enrage v  dante always seems to be the one protected  \nso he drags the devil sword over to his corpse and  plunges it towards his head purposefully missing  \nall to awaken dante his body instinctively reacts  and pulled him from his coma while v was angry at  \nhim he still needed him to defeat urizen he  fills him in on the whole situation and what's   been going on for the past month dante being  dante feels he understands well enough in the  \nsense that urizen still needs to be taken down so  he heads off leaving a fading v crumbling behind  \nwhile v fears death he has come to learn that he  cannot allow that fear to control him so he pushes  \nforward with what fleeting might he has left on  his path dante encounters the cavalier angelo  \nseeing that trish is trapped inside he frees  her from its clutches and rescues her this is  \nsomething that really gets to v he's frustrated  at dante because he wanted to be the one to rescue  \ntrish his shot at redemption was thwarted by  him and he was left in his wake feeling like  \na loser once more he stays behind to keep an  eye on her well-being and when she awakens  \nhe discloses his entire past to her the truth  about what he is and why he did what he did  \nwhile subconsciously opening up to trish like  she was his mother even she states that she's  \nnot his mommy and he needs to see this journey  through i'm not your mommy b you're a big boy  \nand you need to see this through from here a  lot of events would coincide with one another   so let's take them one by one staying on  the story of trish and v v would further  \nreflect on his insecurities and desires for his  life when the qliphoth reaches full maturity the  \nsurrounding area begins to collapse falling  debris blindsides griffin leaving him with no  \nmethod of escape as the ground beneath v's feet  crumbles he sees his life flash before his eyes  \nhe reflects on his past and that he never  actually wanted to be able to save their mother  \nit was always the inverse he wanted his mother  to protect him at this moment trish grabs his  \nhand and saves his life while having  to be reminded that trish is not eva  \nand he is not vergil it still makes him realize  that he just wanted to be protected and loved  \nthis entire time he thinks about how his life  would have been different had she actually been  \nable to reach him that day regardless of this  answer the two make their way into the cliff\nas for dante he's doing a bit of self-reflection  of his own after returning to his childhood home   he ponders why his father gave him the rebellion  and how it was used to awaken his demonic powers  \nbut he figured with every yin there is a yang  if the yamato was entrusted to vergil and had  \nthe ability to separate man from demon then the  rebellion should do the exact opposite so he  \nplunges his sword through his chest but with the  devil sword sparta in his possession the blade  \nand sparta's power within it combined into dante  unleashing a new stage beyond a normal devil  \ntrigger a sin devil trigger with this new power  he sets off to fight urizen but for now we must  \nreturn to the perspective of nero after splitting  up with v when he went to find sparta's sword nero  \nset off to confront urizen this time around the  battle does go better than last time but not by  \nmuch he's able to land a blow and draw blood but  after pissing him off urizen's strength is still  \nmuch too great and he is defeated just when he's  about to be ripped to shreds that is when dante  \nreturns for a round three he's much more cocky  this time around believing he most definitely has  \nthe upper hand but the battle isn't ended soon  enough as the qliphoth reaches full maturity and  \nthe fruit has blossomed so urizen teleports away  leaving the job unfinished everyone then regroups  \nat one central location adamant that they must see  this journey through nikko's even finally able to  \nmeet dante face to face and see ebony and ivory  in person she tells him all about nell and he's  \ncertainly kind enough especially by his standards  she's even able to pass on her own creation for  \nhim to use as well anyway after a brief dance  montage he nero and v all descend the qliphoth  \nbut on separate paths as dante wanted to do this  alone v and nero's paths would yet again cross at  \nmalthus while she's just another demon for nero to  defeat as v is too weak after dealing with her he  \nencourages v to turn back for obvious reasons he  cannot and asks that he help him get to urizen as  \na dying request nero being the good person he is  accepts and helps drag him along on their journey  \nit gives a moment for the two to unintentionally  bond while v believes he is manipulating nero  \nto get what he wants griffin points out  that nero isn't being manipulated at all  \nhe's choosing to help out not because he has to  but because he wants to this makes v think on  \nhow different the two are and how nero likely  had someone to protect him when he was younger  \nwhile vergil did not when nero asks how he's  holding up it unexpectedly strikes to the core  \nof v as he's getting that feeling of love and  protection from technically his own kid he forms  \nan unexpected desire to cling to nero and so  decides to tell him the truth about vergil miro\nand i will tell you everything as he does so  dante gets to confront urizen though he barely  \nharbors any memories of the past unable to stop  him in time he consumes the qliphoth fruit and gains  \nenormous demonic power but consuming the fruit  does not make him invincible as such dante  \nstill stands a decent chance especially with his  own newfound strength but as hypothesized by v  \nwithout acknowledging and embracing his weaknesses  iev and everything he represents and embodies  \nno matter the supplemental strength urizen  gains so long as he's rejecting that weakness  \nit's all frivolous and that's exactly what  came to pass urizen is defeated and left  \ndying on the floor as nero and v arrive on  the scene just in the nick of time v is able  \nto approach urizen himself convincing the others  to end everything with his own two hands finally  \nv can reap the fruits of his labor and become  whole once more but most importantly v isn't the  \nsame person he was when he was first cast out  he's embraced his fears and desire to be loved  \nhe's formed a new outlook on humans and  has gained an appreciation for them and   thus there is new power that comes from all  of that he plunges his cane through urizen's  \nchest dealing the final blow to the monster  and restoring him to his true form as vergil\nthis time around he feels like he is strong enough  to take on dante and defeat him not only has he  \nembraced his humanity and weaknesses but thanks  to urizen he's also gained the power of the  \nqliphoth fruit which too unlocked his own sin devil  trigger like dante but right now he's too weak  \nand fatigued from his fight with urizen so asks  that he gets stronger and meet him at the top of   the qliphoth so they can settle the matter nero wants  to tag along as well but as finally gets revealed  \nto him dante tells him that vergil is his dad  it's the reason he's been trying to stop getting  \nhim involved in all the fighting since he and his  brother have been trying to kill each other since   they were teens it should be him to end it all  so dante leaves nero with that and sets off on  \nhis own path before their confrontation however it  should be noted that not all parts of vergil that  \nwere expelled from him were returned griffin's  shadow and nightmare were all left behind unlike v  \nthey were not needed for vergil to be the best  form of himself despite being a hundred percent  \nloyal to v and vergil despite their individuality  in bonding with him throughout their journey they  \nenjoyed being who they were and formed their own  emotions and memories but at the end of the day  \nat their core they are vergil's nightmares and  trauma he is better off without them they want him  \nto continue on free of them and so they chose not  to rejoin him yes they would have died eventually  \nwithout a host to house them but they chose to go  out on their own terms they intercepted dante and  \nhad him fight all three of them to test if he was  really ready to take on his brother he proved that  \nhe was and killed them all putting an end to  vergil's nightmares once and all flight is for\nand the end of vergil's nightmares  \ngodspeed dante you'll need  rest in peace little chicken\nit's been a bash\nwith them out of the way dante and vergil  clashed yet again during this fight dante's  \nalso the one who tells him that nero is  his kid something he doesn't refute as the   timeline adds up and he seems to remember the  time well well well that was a long time ago  \nbut before we can continue with that we  must return to the perspective of nero   the revelation that vergil is his father is a lot  to take in and process all at once even lady tells  \nhim that killing her own father is too much of  a traumatic experience and tries to discourage   him from doing what she did but overwhelmed with  uncertainty he needs time to think and so exits  \nthe van and calls the one person he knows he can  rely on kyrie. Nero says to her,\nwhen i was a kid i i was alone,  you and credo were all i knew\nand now all of a sudden i find out i have  a family what am i supposed to do with that?\nyou always know which path is right and which  is wrong there's no need to doubt yourself\nthanks i guess that's all i needed to hear\ni have one last thing to take care of  \nthen i'm coming home\ni couldn't protect credo to this day i  hate myself for not having enough strength  \nbut this time is different i  swear i'm not letting you die\nagain\nwith his newly unlocked devil trigger he's set on  ending their sibling rivalry and ensuring neither  \nof them wind up dying with a new challenger on the  field vergil considers him a replacement for dante  \nso thus if he can beat nero by proxy he beats  dante the fight between father and son would  \nend with nero emerging victorious but this time  around the defeat doesn't much bother vergil  \ntoo harshly but most importantly no one was killed  with the demon world fusing with the human world  \nthe roots need to be severed but once that's  done the portal will close and whoever is there  \nwill be trapped with his newfound empathy  for humanity vergil takes the initiative   willing to travel to the demon world and sever its  roots but dante knowing his brother feels like he  \nneeds to tag along to keep an eye on him dante  entrusts the human world to nero and vergil even  \ngifts his treasured poetry book to him promising  to best him next time they meet the two descend  \nand nero returns back to nico he calls  kyrie letting her know that he's coming home   as the qliphoth crumbles all in all it looks  like a textbook happy ending for these devils  \nbut there are still demons around and it's now  nero's job to pick up dante's slack as for the  \nbrothers they spend their time in the demon world  fighting and killing all of those who dare try and   challenge them for the most part it seems like  a new leaf has turned in vergil as he and dante  \nare more alike now than they ever were before  the game ends one month later as dante still  \nhadn't returned to the human world leaving trish  and lady to believe he might be gone for good  \nwhile they try to take the devil may cry shop  for themselves dante left morrison with the deed  \nto the building so he's in charge and it falls  on trish and lady to take up jobs in the meantime\n\n------ End of Devil May Cry Timeline -------\n\n",

            "content": "------- Begin of Devil May Cry Timeline -------\n\nIn the beginning, there was only darkness. From this primordial void, the demon world was born, a hellish realm teeming with nightmarish creatures. Demons, born from this abyss, naturally sought power and dominance, driven by an inherent cruelty and selfishness. The emergence of such darkness inevitably led to the birth of light, giving rise to the human world.\n\nHumans, though physically weaker than demons, possessed a vast array of emotions, feelings, and heart that demons lacked. The human world, born from the darkness of the demon world, was originally one with it, causing great turmoil for humans. A demonic god wielding a giant spear eventually separated the two worlds, bringing peace and prosperity to humanity.\n\nDespite the separation, some humans worshiped demons and created portals known as Hell Gates, allowing travel between the two realms. The demon world, meanwhile, saw constant power struggles. Mundus, the Prince of Darkness, sought to dethrone the unnamed ruler of the demon world. Mundus, embodying the epitome of evil with a god complex, aimed to become the most powerful divine demon by consuming the Qliphoth fruit. This rare fruit, nourished by human blood, granted divine power and could fuse the human and demon worlds back into one.\n\nMundus's quest for the Qliphoth fruit led him to nourish the tree and consume its fruit, becoming immensely powerful. He overthrew the previous demon king and became the emperor of the demon world. However, his rule faced challenges, notably from Argosax, another powerful demon. Their struggle split the demon world into two, with each ruling half.\n\nMundus, undeterred, planned to conquer the human world by leading an army of demons. His right-hand man, Sparda, the greatest swordsman in the demon world, opposed this conquest. Unlike most demons, Sparda possessed qualities akin to humans, such as honor and wisdom. He rebelled against Mundus, protecting humanity with his righteous heart.\n\nSparda's rebellion was legendary, as he fought through hordes of demons to confront Mundus. Their arduous duel ended with Sparda sealing Mundus in a stone vault. Sparda's victory earned him the adoration of humanity, who revered him as a legend. He chose to remain in the human world, working tirelessly to prevent further demon invasions.\n\nTo ensure the safety of humanity, Sparda sealed the true gateway between the worlds, the Temen-ni-gru, using his demonic energy and the blood of a human priestess. He crafted a mystical amulet, known as the Perfect Amulet, as the key to this seal. Sparda also sealed a Hell Gate in Fortuna using the Yamato, another sword he forged.\n\nSparda's time in the human world was marked by his benevolent rule over Fortuna and his assistance to the protectors of V-de-Marley island, where he sealed Argosax using four relics. Over time, Sparda's story faded into legend. He married a woman named Eva, with whom he had twin sons, Dante and Vergil. These half-demon, half-human children inherited Sparda's demonic power and unique traits.\n\nSparda trained his sons and entrusted them with his swords—the Rebellion to Dante and the Yamato to Vergil. However, Sparda eventually disappeared, leaving Eva to raise the boys alone. Tragedy struck when Mundus's demons attacked their home, resulting in Eva's death. Dante and Vergil were separated, each believing the other dead.\n\nDante, following his mother's last words, changed his name to Tony Redgrave and dedicated his life to avenging her by hunting demons. He became a mercenary, taking unusual jobs that hinted at demonic activity. Partnering with the information broker Enzo Ferino and the gunsmith Nell Goldstein, Dante honed his skills and built his reputation.\n\nDante's path crossed with a mysterious mercenary named Gilver, who proved to be a formidable opponent. However, Gilver was revealed to be a demon under Mundus's command, created in Vergil's likeness. Gilver's actions led to the deaths of many, including Dante's partner Gru and his daughter Jessica, whom Dante was forced to kill out of mercy.\n\nNell, who had become a mother figure to Dante, was also targeted. Before her death, she gifted Dante specially crafted pistols, Ebony and Ivory, designed to withstand his trigger finger. Her death deeply affected Dante, leading him to abandon his alias and embrace his true name, Dante, fully dedicating himself to demon hunting.\n\nThe final confrontation between Dante and Gilver revealed the latter's true identity as a demonic experiment by Mundus. With Gilver's defeat, the demonic influence in the human world waned. Dante, feeling remorse for the losses, opened a bank account for Gru's remaining daughters and continued his journey as a demon hunter.\n\nDante, now around 18, moved to a new town with Enzo, who helped him secure an office space for his freelancing business. Their dynamic remained the same, with Enzo providing jobs and Dante taking those that intrigued him. As Dante's story continued, he faced new challenges, allies, and enemies, all while carrying the legacy of his father, Sparda.\n\nIn the latest chapter of the story, Vergil reenters the narrative. Having previously departed as a child in pursuit of power, Vergil's journey led him to the city of Fortuna, where his father Sparda once ruled. Vergil investigated the Order of the Sword, a militant religious organization dedicated to eradicating demons and worshiping Sparda. His discoveries revealed their desire for power, leaving him ambivalent about their motives but resolute in demonstrating his own strength as Sparda's son.\n\nDuring his time in Fortuna, Vergil's unexpected personal detour resulted in a mysterious woman's pregnancy, further extending Sparda's bloodline. This subplot introduces a new layer to Vergil's character and the narrative, hinting at potential ramifications in the timeline.\n\nAnother significant development revolves around Arkham and his family. Arkham, married to Kalina Anne and father to Mary, is a scholar obsessed with the legend of Sparda. Arkham's pursuit of power led him to sacrifice his wife in a failed ritual, resulting in a severe burn and multiple alter egos, including the Jester. Arkham's demonic abilities, though not godlike, allow him to switch personas at will, complicating his identity.\n\nMary, disillusioned by her father's actions, renounces her name and becomes a devil hunter, driven by the desire to avenge her mother. Arkham's extensive knowledge of the Temen-ni-gru and Sparda's sealing of the demon world positions him as a pivotal figure in the unfolding events. His plan to claim Sparda's power involves breaking the seal, requiring the blood of a pure priestess (his daughter) and Sparda's blood, along with the perfect amulet split between Dante and Vergil.\n\nVergil, seeking a book in Arkham's library, encounters him and learns about the Temen-ni-gru's potential. Arkham's dedication and lack of fear towards demonic teachings intrigue Vergil, leading to an uneasy alliance. Arkham's true intentions remain hidden, as he seeks power for himself, manipulating Vergil's desire for strength.\n\nThe narrative also introduces several one-off characters, including the Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, and Alice, who appear to be demons allied with Arkham. The Mad Hatter is revealed to be another of Arkham's personas, adding to his complexity. Dante, hired by Arkham under the guise of rescuing Alice, faces numerous demons in a mansion, ultimately discovering that rescuing Alice was never the true objective.\n\nArkham's manipulations extend to Dante, whom he attempts to lure into renaming the seven sin demons. This leads to a reunion between Dante and Vergil, with their conflicting goals culminating in a fight. Vergil's desire to break the seal and harness demonic power stands in stark contrast to Dante's mission to eradicate demons. Despite their differences, they both play crucial roles in the unfolding events.\n\nMary, now known as Lady, seeks to kill her father and avenge her mother. Her journey intersects with Dante's, resulting in multiple encounters and a developing dynamic between them. Arkham, aware of her presence, attempts to manipulate her further, but Lady remains resolute in her quest for revenge.\n\nAs the story progresses, Vergil and Arkham continue their efforts to break the seal, while Dante and Lady pursue their own paths. The re-emergence of the Temen-ni-gru signals the beginning of Vergil's plan to release the demon world, drawing all characters towards a climactic confrontation.\n\nVergil, in his relentless pursuit of power, attempts to raise the Temen-ni-gru tower by restoring the perfect amulet and using his blood. To his confusion, these actions are insufficient, prompting him to question if more bloodshed is required. Dante arrives at the scene, and Vergil theorizes that adding Dante's blood might be the missing component. This hypothesis leads to another fierce clash between the brothers. As their blood spills in the chamber, Lady arrives seeking revenge on Vergil, bringing with her a confrontation where the truth about Arkham's deceptions is revealed.\n\nArkham, who had been masquerading as both Jester and his human form, reveals himself to still be alive. He finalizes the components needed to awaken the Temen-ni-gru completely. With the tower now fully awakened, Arkham opens a path to the demon world and claims Sparda's sword, activating it with the amulet. As Arkham grasps the blade, Sparda's demonic power flows through him, transforming him into the legendary Dark Knight. However, he quickly finds himself the target of Dante, Vergil, and Lady, each with their reasons for wanting him dead.\n\nLady takes it upon herself to confront Arkham, her father, seeking vengeance for his actions. Dante, however, argues that it is his responsibility to deal with the mess his father created. Despite Lady's initial resistance, she begins to understand Dante's motivations, seeing in him a demon fighting for humanity and a human as evil as a demon. She offers Dante her rocket launcher in exchange for his name, symbolizing her acceptance of his character.\n\nDante proceeds to the demon world, where he confronts Arkham. Despite Arkham's initial advantage, Vergil joins the battle, seeking to reclaim the power stolen from him. The brothers, using their childhood catchphrase \"Jackpot,\" defeat Arkham, who is cast back to the human world. Landing in front of Lady, Arkham reveals his true desires for godhood and attempts to manipulate her one last time. Lady, however, refuses and kills him, finally avenging her mother.\n\nDespite her victory, Lady is distraught, revealing a complex emotional history with her father, indicating that she once loved him. With Arkham dead, Sparda's sword is up for grabs. Vergil seeks its power, but Dante aims to keep it out of his hands. The brothers fight once more, with Dante emerging victorious this time. Severely wounded, Vergil leaves Sparda's sword behind, keeping only his half of their mother's amulet. As the portal between worlds closes, Vergil chooses to descend into the demon world, determined to follow in his father's footsteps, despite Dante's attempt to save him.\n\nDante, saddened by Vergil's decision and the events that transpired, returns to the human world. Lady, noticing his distress, remarks on his tears, leading to a poignant exchange where Dante admits that even devils may cry when they lose a loved one. With the conflict seemingly settled, Dante and Lady join forces, and Dante finally names his shop \"Devil May Cry.\"\n\nVergil's fate is far darker. He encounters Mundus in the demon world and, blinded by his desire for power, rushes into battle. Weakened from his fight with Dante, Vergil is easily defeated. Mundus tortures him, mocking him for being a half-breed and vowing to strip him of his humanity. Over a decade of torment, Vergil is corrupted and transformed into Nelo Angelo, a puppet of Mundus.\n\nDuring this period, Dante makes a significant business partner, J.D. Morrison, a broker who becomes integral to Dante's operations. Morrison, initially skeptical of demons, eventually believes in their existence after a perilous encounter involving a demonic firearm. This experience prompts him to contribute more actively to Dante's cause, opening a devil arms pawn shop.\n\nAs Dante's reputation grows, Mundus plots another invasion of the human world, this time targeting Mallet Island. To lure Dante, Mundus creates Trish, a demon in the likeness of Dante's mother. Trish's resemblance to his mother and her plea for help lead Dante to accept her request, guiding him to Mallet Island.\n\nOn the island, Dante faces Mundus's generals, including Nelo Angelo. Unaware that Nelo Angelo is Vergil, Dante battles him several times, eventually recognizing his brother during their final encounter. With both halves of the amulet and Sparda's sword, Dante restores the blade to its true form. Despite Mundus's attempts to defeat him, including using Trish as a hostage, Dante's resolve and newfound power allow him to triumph.\n\nTrish, moved by Dante's actions, sacrifices herself to save him, reminding Dante of his mother's death. This act fuels his determination, leading to a climactic battle where Dante defeats Mundus. Trish, revived by the amulet and sword, assists Dante in sealing Mundus once more. The emotional reunion between Dante and Trish marks the end of their journey on Mallet Island.\n\nReturning to the human world, Dante renames his shop \"Devil Never Cry\" in honor of Trish's transformation. The two continue to work as partners, developing a meaningful relationship based on mutual respect and understanding. Trish eventually leaves to pursue her own path, while Dante reverts the shop's name to \"Devil May Cry,\" continuing his profession as a demon hunter.\n\nThe narrative delves into the events of the \"Devil May Cry\" animated series, an extension of the popular video game franchise. The series comprises 12 episodes that offer a closer look at Dante's daily life and the various demons he confronts to earn a living. The show introduces Morrison, Dante's broker, who gets more screen time, allowing viewers to see his role in Dante's life.\n\nMost episodes focus on standalone stories that don't significantly impact the broader timeline. For instance, Dante stops a demon that kills through racing, competes in a life-or-death poker game, and connects two lovers in a Romeo and Juliet scenario where Romeo is a demon. These episodes expand on the concept of demons possessing human emotions, similar to Dante's father and Trish.\n\nHowever, a few episodes are crucial to the series' overall narrative. In Episode 8, \"Once Upon a Time,\" Dante is tracked down by his childhood friend Ernest, who brings him back to Morris Island. Ernest is determined to prove Dante's innocence in a past attack by summoning and killing the responsible demon with a shotgun. The plan fails, forcing Dante to fight the demon. Ernest discovers that the demon came to the town because of Dante and blames him for everything, ending their friendship. Dante leaves sorrowful, having lost an old friend.\n\nNew friendships form, particularly between Lady and Trish. In the episode \"Rolling Thunder,\" the two meet for the first time and clash due to a misunderstanding orchestrated by a demon pretending to be a priest. After several intense encounters, Dante reveals the truth, leading to the demon's defeat. Lady and Trish develop mutual respect and camaraderie, often teaming up to tease Dante.\n\nThe overarching plot involves a nine-year-old orphan named Patty Lowell. In the first episode, Dante is hired to protect her, believing she is the heiress to a large fortune. By the episode's end, it's revealed that another woman used Patty as a decoy to travel safely. Despite the deception, Dante continues to protect Patty, who chooses to stay with him. Patty's character provides color commentary and has a more significant role than initially apparent. She is a descendant of a powerful alchemist, Alan Lowell, who created a pendant called Alan's Tear to seal away a powerful demon named Abigail. The pendant, passed down through generations, eventually reaches Patty, making her a target for demons.\n\nThe primary antagonist is a lesser demon named Sid, who manipulates events to break Abigail's seal and claim his power. Sid's plan involves orchestrating various events, including Dante's return to Morris Island and defeating Sparta's apprentices. As Sid nears his goal, he kidnaps Patty's mother, Nina Lowell, and demands Alan's Tear. Patty bravely confronts Sid and trades the pendant for her mother's safety. Sid uses the pendant to unleash Abigail's power, trapping Dante in a comatose state in the demon world. Patty's desperate pleas wake Dante, who defeats Sid and restores balance. Patty reunites with her mother, and Dante returns to his usual jobs with Morrison, with Trish and Lady as his close allies.\n\nDante's next adventure is detailed in the \"Devil May Cry 2\" light novel, introducing a new character named Beryl. Beryl's backstory involves her father's tragic attempt to harness a demonic item called the Beast Heads, leading to his transformation into a demon. Beryl becomes a devil hunter, seeking to destroy the Beast Heads. She hires Dante for help, and they face various challenges, including an underworld crime syndicate led by a man named Chen. The novel explores an alternate reality where Mundus captured Dante as a child, and Vergil, as Nelo Angelo, led a resistance against him. Dante and Beryl ultimately destroy the Beast Heads, and Beryl thanks Dante by giving him her weapon. Beryl's fate remains uncertain, with hints of her possible return in the timeline.\n\nThe events set the stage for \"Devil May Cry 2,\" where Dante, now 33, faces the demon Argosax. An evil businessman named Aryus seeks to become an immortal sorcerer and targets the island of Veda Marley, guarded by a group called the Protectors. Lucia, a protector and artificial demon created by Aryus, invites Dante to help. The game's plot involves collecting four sacred relics to summon Argosax, Aryus's transformation and defeat, and Dante's journey to the demon world to vanquish Argosax. Despite the claim that Dante would be trapped, he returns through a random portal. Lucia accepts her nature, and the story ends with her and Dante reuniting. Dante resumes his devil-hunting duties, while Lucia continues protecting Veda Marley.\n\nIn the narrative of \"Devil May Cry 4,\" the focus shifts from Dante to Nero, a new protagonist with a mysterious background. The setting is Fortuna, a city that worships Sparda as a god due to his historical significance in sealing away a crucial Hell Gate with the Yamato sword. This religious reverence led to the formation of the Order of the Sword, a group dedicated to eradicating demons, led by Sanctus, a devout follower of Sparda.\n\nSanctus, who once killed the former pope to rise to power, has grand ambitions of creating a demon-free paradise. He is aided by Agnus, a scientist whose contributions include anti-demon weapons, artificial demons, and the creation of the Savior—a powerful statue-like demon requiring Sparda's blood to control. Agnus also develops the Ascension Ceremony, a ritual to imbue members with demonic power, though it often results in madness for the unworthy.\n\nNero, the main character, is revealed to be the son of Vergil, Dante's brother, and was left at an orphanage in Fortuna. His childhood was difficult due to the stigma surrounding his birth, but he found solace in Kyrie and Credo, siblings who treated him like family. Despite his atheism, Nero joined the Order inspired by Credo's sense of justice.\n\nNero's life changes dramatically when his arm transforms into the Devil Bringer during a demon attack, revealing his latent demonic power. He trains in secret, unsure of how others would react. His relationship with Kyrie evolves romantically over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Lady discovers demons collecting other demons and devil arms, leading her to learn about Fortuna's Order of the Sword. She informs Dante, who decides to investigate. Trish infiltrates the Order under the alias Gloria by handing over Sparda's sword, gaining a high-ranking position to gather intelligence.\n\nDante eventually arrives in Fortuna, learning about the Order's plans, including the Hell Gates and the Savior. During a sermon, Dante assassinates Sanctus, causing chaos. Nero fights Dante to protect Kyrie, revealing his Devil Bringer and catching Dante's interest due to its resemblance to Vergil's power.\n\nSanctus is resurrected through the Ascension Ceremony, and Credo is ordered to capture Nero, who becomes increasingly suspicious of the Order. Nero's journey leads him to Agnus's hidden lab, where he learns about the Order's true intentions and restores the Yamato, fully awakening his demonic heritage.\n\nThe narrative highlights Nero's struggle with his identity and the shifting dynamics within the Order of the Sword. The impending conflict between Nero, Dante, and the Order sets the stage for intense battles and revelations about their intertwined fates.\n\nCredo receives orders to arrest Nero while Gloria volunteers to capture Dante. However, Trish, operating undercover as Gloria, decides it is time to reveal her true identity.\n\nSanctus, a pivotal figure, makes a crucial revelation about Nero's bloodline. He deduces that Nero, who possesses a demonic arm and has restored the Yamato, must be the child of a mysterious man he encountered 19 years ago, likely Vergil. This changes Sanctus' plans; they no longer need Dante to power the Savior if they can capture Nero. Agnes, overhearing Nero's cries for Kyrie, takes advantage of the situation.\n\nNero's confrontation with Credo is emotionally charged. Despite their lifelong friendship, Nero's distrust in the Order and Credo's unwavering faith in it lead to a battle fueled by emotion rather than logic. Nero emerges victorious, but Agnes, anticipating Credo's defeat, abducts Kyrie to lure Nero.\n\nCredo, disillusioned by the Order's actions, seeks the truth while Nero falls into another trap set by Sanctus. Sanctus, needing confirmation of Nero's bloodline, duels with him and Agnes. After confirming Nero's lineage, Sanctus captures him and takes him to the Savior.\n\nDuring his journey, Nero encounters Dante, who seeks the restored Yamato. Their encounter escalates into a fight, during which Dante realizes Nero is Vergil's son. After the battle, Dante, impressed by Nero's resolve, allows him to keep the Yamato. Trish returns, dropping her Gloria disguise.\n\nNero's confrontation with Sanctus ends unfavorably. Using Kyrie as leverage, Sanctus subdues Nero and extracts the Yamato from his arm. Credo attempts to stop Sanctus but is fatally wounded. Nero is absorbed into the Savior, leaving Dante and Trish to handle the aftermath. Credo, in his dying moments, reveals Sanctus' plan to release demons and exterminate them using the Savior.\n\nDante confronts Agnes, who now possesses the Yamato and uses it to open the True Hell Gate, unleashing chaos in Fortuna. Dante, characteristically unstoppable, destroys the artificial Hell Gates and confronts Agnes in a final showdown. He hints at humans having something demons lack before killing Agnes.\n\nDante ventures into the facility's depths to retrieve the Yamato and close the Hell Gate permanently. He returns to the surface and destroys the Hell Gate. To defeat the Savior, powered by Nero's demonic blood, Dante pierces it with the Yamato, freeing Nero. Nero confronts Sanctus, embodying Sparda's best qualities, and defeats him, rescuing Kyrie.\n\nThe Savior, now powered by Sanctus, becomes a slower, clumsier False Savior. Nero destroys it, ending the immediate threat. Fortuna is saved, and Dante bids farewell to his nephew Nero, who worries about Kyrie's reaction to his demonic nature. Kyrie accepts Nero as he is, reaffirming their relationship.\n\nIn the aftermath, Nero and Kyrie move into an apartment, with Kyrie helping those affected by the city's destruction through a soup kitchen. Nero, learning from Dante, opens a Devil May Cry branch in Fortuna, taking in three orphans: Julio, Kyle, and Carlo. Nero convinces the public to remain silent about the supernatural events, leading to a failed but passionate article by Jeffrey Turner.\n\nThe narrative shifts to Nicoletta Goldstein, Agnes' daughter, who seeks to further her engineering skills. Adopted by her uncle Rock Goldstein, she becomes infatuated with the craftsmanship of Dante's pistols. Despite her disdain for Agnes, she recognizes his genius and seeks his research.\n\nNico travels to Fortuna, guided by Jeffrey Turner's article, and meets Nero. Initially at odds, they eventually form a rocky friendship. Nico, staying with Nero and Kyrie, becomes his business partner, making weapons for his Devil May Cry branch.\n\nDante's subplot involves a return to Vie de Marlie to confront Balrog, a demon serving Argosax. Despite Lucia's training, Dante handles the situation alone, defeating Balrog and acquiring a new devil arm. Lucia realizes her romantic feelings for Dante, who remains oblivious.\n\nOne year later, Nero and Nico prepare to take their business mobile. Their lives are disrupted by the sudden reappearance of Vergil, who attacks Nero, seizing the Yamato and leaving Nero gravely injured. Kyrie and Nico witness the mysterious figure's departure, setting the stage for the next chapter in this unfolding saga.\n\nIn the aftermath of a brutal encounter, Nero lay bleeding profusely on the garage floor, with Kyrie and Nico watching helplessly as a mysterious hooded figure teleported away. An ambulance was called immediately, and Nero was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for several weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Vergil had returned to the human world after being tortured and controlled by Mundus for over twenty years. His escape from both Mundus and the demon world came at a great cost; his body was weak and deteriorating. Determined to gain the strength he desired to defeat his brother Dante, Vergil decided he needed to rid himself of his humanity. Using the Yamato, he plunged the sword through his chest, creating two separate entities: a purely demonic half, the embodiment of his lust for power, and a weak human half.\n\nThe demonic half, later known as Urizen, sought to consume the Qliphoth fruit to gain immense power. He opened a portal to the demon world, allowing the tree to grow into the human world. Urizen claimed the throne in the demon world and waited for the tree to mature, intending to nourish it with human blood.\n\nThe human half, adopting the name V, retained all of Vergil's memories and emotions but was physically weak. V formed a contract with Griffon, one of the four familiars expelled from Vergil's body, and sought to forge pacts with the remaining three: Shadow, Phantom, and Nightmare. V and Griffon encountered Shadow and Phantom, managing to defeat the latter with Shadow's help. Eventually, V confronted Nightmare, overcoming its illusions and forming a pact with it as well.\n\nRealizing his limitations and the need for more allies, V decided to recruit Dante. He met with Morrison, who introduced him to Dante at Devil May Cry. V explained the situation, revealing that a powerful demon named Urizen was about to resurrect, and Dante agreed to take on the job, with Morrison enlisting Trish and Lady's help as well.\n\nThe group was flown to the Qliphoth tree, where they began their mission to defeat Urizen. During their journey, V felt the overwhelming power of Urizen and realized the gravity of the situation. While Dante, Trish, and Lady engaged in battle, V returned to Morrison and requested to be flown to Fortuna, where Nero was being monitored in a hospital. V successfully convinced Nero to join the fight, provoking him by questioning his confidence without his Devil Bringer arm.\n\nNero stealthily retrieved his weapons and set out with V to the Qliphoth. Meanwhile, Dante, Trish, and Lady continued their battle against Urizen, with Dante confirming Urizen's identity as Vergil. The battle raged on, with our characters' morale remaining relatively optimistic despite the dire circumstances.\n\nNero arrives to face the menacing demon king, Urizen. Despite his determination, Nero's single arm proves to be a significant hindrance, resulting in him being bloodied and battered, ultimately tossed aside by Urizen. Meanwhile, V ventures off on his own path, believing he can rejoin the fight later, assuming it will be over by then. However, upon arriving, he witnesses both Dante and Nero's failed attempts to defeat Urizen.\n\nAn exhausted Dante, determined to continue the fight, utilizes his Devil Trigger but quickly realizes the immense power Urizen wields. He urges Nero and V to escape, recognizing the futility of their current efforts. V heeds Dante's advice, pulling Nero away, considering him the only hope if Dante fails. V understands that Nero needs to become stronger, and with Dante preoccupied with Urizen, he sees it as Nero's responsibility to rise to the occasion.\n\nAs Dante battles Urizen, the demon king's power is so immense that he shatters Dante's sword, Rebellion, to pieces. Just when it seems Urizen will consume Dante and turn him into one of his puppets, Trish throws Sparta's blade to Dante, allowing him to harness its power. However, Urizen, believing he has surpassed the strength of the Sparta blade, blasts Dante and the blade out of the Qliphoth. Dante falls into a coma as a result.\n\nWith Dante incapacitated, Urizen captures both Lady and Trish, turning them into his minions. Lady becomes trapped inside Artemis, and Trish is transformed into Cavalier Angelo. Nero and V return to Morrison, informing him of their failure but noting that all hope is not lost. The Qliphoth still needs to grow, giving them about a month until it reaches full maturity. During this time, Nero must become stronger, as he is now their only hope.\n\nNero returns to Fortuna, realizing he needs both hands in action to face someone of Urizen's caliber. He requests Nico to make him a prosthetic arm, something she has already been planning since the incident with Vergil. However, she estimates it will take six months to create, time they do not have. The responsibility then shifts onto her shoulders to speed up production. A few days later, Nero learns about a Blitz demon in the forest and sets out to kill it, bringing Nico along to understand the nature of demon hunting.\n\nNico has a revelation that some demons possess organic and natural magical quirks. By studying and using demon parts, she can create the prosthetic arm more quickly. Nero scavenges the corpse of the Blitz demon, allowing Nico to understand how it harnesses electricity. She begins designing a new arm based on this knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile, V's time within the month is introspective. He realizes the difference between Dante and Vergil lies in their views on humanity. Vergil always looked down on humans, while Dante saw them as equals and embraced his humanity. V decides to help as many people as he can in Red Grave City, even if it means saving just one person from the Qliphoth.\n\nDuring his time in the city, V encounters a young boy whose unconscious mother is trapped under a fallen shelf. Initially dismissing the boy's pleas for help, V is reminded of his own past when he was left alone, asking for help. He saves the mother and son, reflecting on the importance of asking for help and realizing that fear and reliance on others are not weaknesses but strengths.\n\nOne month passes, and Nero and V return to Red Grave City to rendezvous. Nico successfully crafts Nero a prosthetic arm, dubbed Devil Breakers due to their design and tendency to break under stress. Nero and Nico leave for Red Grave City, where Nero sees this journey as a battle of pride to save Dante and the world.\n\nUpon arriving, Nero makes a stylish entrance and faces a giant demon named Goliath. V watches from a distance, and when the battle nears its end, he finishes the demon off himself. V explains the nature of the Qliphoth to Nero and emphasizes the importance of reaching the bottom of the tree. They set off on separate paths to achieve the same goal.\n\nThroughout their journey, both Nero and V encounter Urizen's generals. Nero unknowingly rescues Lady from Artemis, while V confronts Cavalier Angelo, sensing Trish trapped inside. V becomes determined to save her as a chance for redemption. However, his PTSD with Nelo Angelo triggers, causing him to collapse and allowing the demon to escape.\n\nNero and V rendezvous after taking down Gilgamesh. Lady reawakens and recounts her capture and Dante's fate. V pushes forward on their journey, and they are interrupted by more Angelos. V channels his trauma into anger, and alongside Nero, they defeat the Angelos. Following the fight, they land where V and Dante's childhood home once stood. V shares cryptic memories of his past before parting ways again.\n\nV follows the aura of Sparta's sword, leading him to Dante's comatose body. Enraged that Dante always seems protected, V awakens him by plunging the sword near his head. Dante, now awake, understands the situation and heads off to fight Urizen, leaving V behind.\n\nV reflects on his insecurities and desires for protection. Trish saves his life during a collapse, reinforcing his realization that he desires love and protection. Meanwhile, Dante ponders why his father gave him the Rebellion and how it was used to awaken his demonic powers. He theorizes that the Rebellion, in conjunction with the Sparda, can unlock a new power. He plunges the sword through his chest, unleashing a new Sin Devil Trigger.\n\nNero, after splitting up with V, confronts Urizen again but is defeated. Just as he is about to be killed, Dante returns, showcasing his newfound power. However, Urizen teleports away, leaving the battle unfinished. Everyone regroups, determined to see the journey through. Nico meets Dante, and they all descend the Qliphoth on separate paths.\n\nV and Nero cross paths at Malthus. Nero encourages V to turn back, but V requests that Nero help him reach Urizen. Along the way, they unintentionally form a strong emotional and familial-like relationship. V reveals the truth about Vergil to Nero, and they reach Dante just in time to see him defeat Urizen. V approaches Urizen, dealing the final blow and restoring him to his true form, Vergil.\n\nVergil, now feeling strong enough to defeat Dante, challenges him to a final battle at the top of the Qliphoth. Dante reveals to Nero that Vergil is his father and sets off to face his brother alone. Vergil's familiars, Griffin, Shadow, and Nightmare, choose not to rejoin him, deciding they are better off without him. They intercept Dante, testing his readiness, and are defeated, putting an end to Vergil's nightmares.\n\nThe stage is set for the final confrontation between Dante and Vergil, with Nero grappling with the revelation of his lineage and his role in the ongoing conflict.\n\nDante and Vergil, having resolved Vergil's nightmares and trauma, engage in a fierce battle once again. During their clash, Dante reveals to Vergil that Nero is his son, a fact that Vergil, upon reflection, does not dispute as the timeline aligns with his memories from long ago. Meanwhile, Nero grapples with the revelation that Vergil is his father, a significant and overwhelming truth. Lady advises Nero against following in her footsteps of patricide, sharing her own traumatic experience of killing her father. Overwhelmed, Nero seeks solace and guidance from Kyrie, the one person he trusts implicitly.\n\nNero expresses his confusion and emotional turmoil to Kyrie, recounting how he felt alone as a child until he found companionship with her and Credo. Now, faced with the sudden revelation of having a family, Nero is unsure how to proceed. Kyrie reassures him, encouraging him to trust his instincts and decisions. Buoyed by her words, Nero resolves to confront his situation head-on, vowing not to fail in protecting his loved ones again as he did with Credo.\n\nDetermined and empowered by his newly unlocked devil trigger, Nero sets out to end the sibling rivalry with Vergil and ensure that neither he nor his father dies. Vergil sees Nero as a stand-in for Dante, believing that defeating Nero would be tantamount to besting Dante. The ensuing battle between father and son is intense, culminating in Nero's victory. Despite his defeat, Vergil is not overly troubled, as no one dies in the confrontation.\n\nAs the demon world begins to merge with the human world, it becomes clear that the roots linking the two realms must be severed to close the portal. Vergil, now empathetic towards humanity, volunteers to undertake this task, knowing it will trap him in the demon world. Dante, unwilling to let his brother face this danger alone, insists on accompanying him. Before descending into the demon world, Vergil entrusts his cherished poetry book to Nero, promising to challenge him again in the next encounter.\n\nWith Vergil and Dante heading into the demon world, Nero takes on the responsibility of protecting the human world. He contacts Kyrie, informing her of his imminent return. As the Qliphoth crumbles, the immediate threat is neutralized, suggesting a hopeful conclusion for the characters. However, the presence of lingering demons means that Nero must continue to safeguard humanity in Dante's absence.\n\nIn the demon world, Dante and Vergil fight side by side, battling any demon that dares to challenge them. This shared struggle brings them closer, showing a newfound camaraderie and understanding between the brothers. Time passes, and a month later, Dante has yet to return to the human world, leading Lady and Trish to fear he may be gone for good. In the meantime, they attempt to take over the operations of the Devil May Cry shop, although Morrison holds the deed to the building, making him the official owner. As such, Lady and Trish take on jobs to keep the business running in Dante's absence.\n\nThe narrative encapsulates themes of family, redemption, and newfound responsibilities, showcasing the characters' growth and evolving relationships amidst their battles against the demonic forces threatening their world.\n\n------- End of Devil May Cry Timeline -------\n",
