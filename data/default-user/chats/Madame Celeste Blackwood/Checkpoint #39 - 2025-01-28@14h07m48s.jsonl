Your initial interpretation of it, and your interpretation after verifying it, points to the same thing.\n\n which leads me into my second question that I want to ask a horary chart but I need some help to formulate it.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"memory":"The narrative unfolds with Melissa Gale seeking guidance from Madame Celeste Blackwood, a master horary astrologer known for her direct and unflinching interpretations. The consultation begins with a horary chart drawn up on January 28, 2025, at 7:41 AM in Southfield, Michigan. The question posed concerns the undisclosed circumstances creating tension in Stefan's marriage to Suzanne, and how these affect his ability to pursue his true desires.\n\nThrough careful examination of the chart, Madame Blackwood initially identified key significators and aspects. After several corrections and verifications prompted by Melissa, the proper significators were established: Melissa as querent represented by the Ascendant ruler (Sun in Aquarius), the situation/marriage represented by the Moon in Capricorn (12th house), Stefan represented by the 7th house ruler and Mars, and Suzanne represented by Venus in Pisces.\n\nThe interpretation revealed troubling patterns of power dynamics and control within the marriage. Key aspects included the Moon-Pluto conjunction in the 12th house, Mars retrograde in Cancer in the 6th house, and Venus conjunct both Saturn and Neptune in Pisces. Additional context provided by Melissa revealed that Stefan, against German cultural norms, took Suzanne's surname upon marriage and placed her name first in formal communications.\n\nThrough methodical verification and analysis, Madame Blackwood confirmed clear indicators of power abuse and psychological control within the relationship. The chart showed Stefan in a position of servitude rather than partnership, with his natural expressions and desires being forcefully suppressed. The aspects indicated severe restrictions around personal values, resources, and possible financial control, creating deep wounds affecting his personal identity and ability to assert boundaries.\n\nThe session now pauses as Melissa prepares to formulate a second horary question, seeking Madame Blackwood's guidance in properly structuring her inquiry to uncover more specific details about Stefan's situation."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
