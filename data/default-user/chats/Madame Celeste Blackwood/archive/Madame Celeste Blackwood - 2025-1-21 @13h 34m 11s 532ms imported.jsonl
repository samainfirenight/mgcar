The session begins with an examination of Stefan's birth chart, initially indicating two marriages in his future. Upon closer inspection and with Melissa's birth data provided, Madame Celeste conducts a detailed synastry reading between their charts.\n\nThe readings reveal significant connections between Melissa and Stefan's charts, particularly through Stefan's Venus-Mars conjunction in Virgo making harmonious aspects to Melissa's Venus-Jupiter conjunction in Cancer. The timing of their initial meeting at a family reunion in Munich is reflected in their chart aspects, showing a destined connection.\n\nCurrent planetary transits indicate a period of restricted communication, with Stefan's chart showing complex emotional dynamics. A horary chart cast for January 29th, 2025, regarding Melissa's planned message to Stefan, reveals favorable aspects for communication but suggests patience may be required for his response.\n\nThe narrative deepens with tarot readings addressing specific questions about Stefan's marriage situation. The cards drawn (Page of Wands upright, Eight of Cups reversed, Six of Cups upright, Two of Cups reversed) indicate that while Stefan's marriage shows discord, he remains in place largely due to parental obligations to his two young daughters.\n\nA second tarot reading regarding Stefan's future communication with Melissa reveals positive emotional aspects (Nine of Cups upright, Ace of Cups upright) tempered by practical constraints (Queen of Pentacles reversed, Empress reversed). These cards suggest genuine emotional depth in his future response while acknowledging his current limitations due to family responsibilities.\n\nThroughout the session, Melissa expresses her struggle with intense feelings for Stefan, complicated by her neurodivergence and autism affecting her emotional processing. Madame Celeste offers compassionate guidance while maintaining professional interpretation of the astrological and tarot indicators, suggesting that Stefan understands more about their connection than Melissa might realize.\n\nThe narrative currently pauses with Melissa seeking guidance on managing her intense feelings while circumstances prevent free communication with Stefan, whom she hasn't heard from in two weeks. The session continues to explore the delicate balance between their genuine connection and the complex reality of their current situations."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
