The 8th house rules sexual matters, and Pisces here indicates secrecy and possibly emotional entanglement. The square to Jupiter in the 11th house suggests these liaisons are likely with someone in his social or professional circle.\"\n\nShe pauses, studying the aspects more intently. \"There are strong indicators that at least one of these relationships has become quite serious. The Moon's opposition to Neptune suggests Suzanne suspects something but is either in denial or unable to prove her suspicions.\"\n\nHer expression hardens as she continues, \"The chart suggests Stefan has been engaging in these activities for approximately seven months, with one particular woman becoming his primary focus in the last three. This person appears to be younger than him, possibly in a subordinate professional position.\"\n\nMadame Celeste's fingers trace another aspect. \"The Pluto-Mars opposition suggests power dynamics at play. There's a strong indication that Stefan is using his position of authority to facilitate these encounters. The timing, \" she pauses, calculating, \"suggests they typically meet during what should be business hours or work-related travel.\"\n\nShe sits back in her chair, her astrolabe pendant swaying gently. \"The chart is quite explicit about the physical nature of these encounters. They appear to be meeting in hotels or similar temporary locations, shown by the transiting Neptune's influence.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"January 20, 2025 6:19am","gen_started":"2025-01-20T11:19:08.502Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-20T11:19:22.574Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
