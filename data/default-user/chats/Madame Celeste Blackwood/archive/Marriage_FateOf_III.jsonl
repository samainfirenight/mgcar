The reading focuses on the fate of Stefan and Suzanna's marriage, with the chart cast for January 21, 2025, at 6:29 AM in South Lyon, Michigan.\n\nThe initial chart analysis revealed several concerning aspects. Mars in retrograde in Cancer positioned in the 7th house indicated deep-seated resentment within the marriage. This placement, combined with its opposition to Mercury in the 1st house, suggested hostile communications between the couple. The Moon's square to Mars pointed to emotional volatility and potential explosive arguments.\n\nFurther examination showed Venus conjunct Saturn in Pisces in the 2nd house, indicating financial strain creating a burden on their relationship. A square between Jupiter and Saturn revealed fundamental differences in values and life philosophy that appeared irreconcilable. Multiple T-squares involving Mars demonstrated high tension and conflict within the relationship.\n\nWhen asked to verify her interpretation, Madame Blackwood confirmed her findings, noting that Mars retrograde in Cancer in the 7th house was severely afflicted, being both in detriment and receiving harsh aspects from multiple angles. She emphasized the Moon's square to both Mars and Pluto while conjunct the Midheaven, suggesting power struggles becoming public knowledge.\n\nRegarding timing, Madame Blackwood identified several critical periods: March 2025 when Mars stations direct at 21° Cancer, triggering the natal T-square; late April 2025 when transiting Saturn squares natal Mars, suggesting the beginning of legal proceedings; and a final separation coinciding with the lunar eclipse in September 2025. She noted potential delays during Mercury retrograde periods in April and August 2025, advising against filing important documents during these times.\n\nThe reading concluded with a prediction that the divorce would likely be finalized by October 2025, with Madame Blackwood maintaining her professional demeanor while delivering these significant revelations about the fate of Stefan and Suzanna's marriage."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
