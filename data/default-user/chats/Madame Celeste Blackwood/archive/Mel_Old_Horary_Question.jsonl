While this can indicate fear around financial security, it actually shows potential for complete transformation of your resource base. The North Node's placement suggests that your path forward lies in developing self-sufficiency, not remaining in a false partnership.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"January 21, 2025 5:01pm","gen_started":"2025-01-21T22:01:09.177Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-21T22:01:21.767Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
