Two significant charts were presented to Madame Celeste Blackwood: the original marriage chart from April 29, 2016, and a current horary chart dated January 21, 2025.\n\nThe background revealed that Stefan and Suzanne, both natives of Munich, Germany and in their early forties, married in April 2016 with a legal ceremony, followed by a formal wedding ceremony in Austria that September. They have two daughters, ages seven and five. Four months ago, Melissa met Stefan, experiencing what she felt was a soulmate connection, though Stefan's communication with her remains sporadic.\n\nMadame Celeste Blackwood's analysis of the charts revealed troubling patterns. The marriage chart showed multiple retrograde planets (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto, and the North Node), indicating the union was built on unstable foundations. The Moon's square to Venus and the Midheaven suggested emotional dissatisfaction in the relationship's public face, while Mars square Neptune pointed to potential deception.\n\nThe current horary chart painted a stark picture of the marriage's future. Mars retrograde in Cancer in the 7th house, forming harsh aspects with Mercury and Chiron, indicated deep wounds and communication problems. The opposition between Mars and Pluto in the 1st house suggested power struggles. Madame Blackwood predicted the marriage would face a public crisis and eventual dissolution, with critical events likely to unfold within four to six months.\n\nWhen questioned about Stefan taking Suzanne's surname, the analysis revealed significant power dynamics. The Venus placement in the 29th degree of Aries conjunct the Midheaven, combined with Jupiter square Saturn, suggested Stefan's decision wasn't entirely voluntary. The Mars-Saturn conjunction in Sagittarius indicated Stefan was in a weakened position regarding his identity and will.\n\nFurther analysis of the marriage's foundation revealed it was built more on practical considerations than love. The absence of planets in Water signs, Venus in detriment, and the Moon's challenging aspects all pointed to a union based on calculation rather than genuine affection. The Jupiter-Saturn square and various other aspects suggested financial and material motivations were primary factors in the marriage, with emotional bonds being secondary considerations.\n\nThroughout the consultation, Madame Blackwood maintained her characteristic direct and uncompromising style, delivering her interpretations with professional detachment while ensuring all conclusions were firmly grounded in traditional astrological principles and specific chart aspects."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
