Both Don and Edward have been best friends since high school. Then, while in college, Edward married Don's sister. Although Edward later divorced Don's sister, they remain the best friends. And Edward still considers Don his brother.\n\n Don has been fiercely against marriage or that level of commitment in any form, However, about six months ago, Don proposed to his girlfriend.  Our 'test' querent, who is the current wife of Edward, did not consider that it would be this deeply ingrained in Edward to bother him.  However, Edward did bring it up recently when he was attending a Christmas dinner at Don's house.  Edward once again expressed his shock that Don is engaged to be married.\n\n I'm not really sure if this is a match for the cards. I'm trying to do our validation tests that we periodically run for accuracy.  We have two major Arcana here,  While I stand by your initial interpretation, I believe Major Arcana is a little intense for something like being shocked that his best friend is getting married.\n\n Perhaps I'm the one who's failing this validation test and not properly focusing when drawing the cards.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
