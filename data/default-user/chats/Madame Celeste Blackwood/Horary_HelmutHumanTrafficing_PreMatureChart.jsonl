Her fingers trace over the aspects with deliberate precision as she begins her interpretation:\n\n\"Based on these aspects, particularly the stellium in Pisces involving Venus (father's significator) conjoined with Neptune and Saturn in the 9th house of foreign matters, there are strong indicators of deception and hidden criminal activities involving cross-border movements.\n\nThe father's significator, Venus, is in its fall in Pisces, suggesting compromised moral judgment. Its conjunction with Neptune, the planet of illusion and deception, in Neptune's own sign and house of foreign matters, points strongly to involvement in international criminal enterprises.\n\nMars retrograde in the 12th house of hidden enemies and self-undoing, making hard aspects to Mercury and Chiron, suggests covert operations and potential violence. The opposition to Mercury in particular points to concealed communications and secret plans.\n\nThe Pluto-Mercury conjunction in the 6th house, opposing the Ascendant, indicates transformation through service - but in this case, the service appears to be of a dark nature, involving exploitation (Pluto) and calculated planning (Mercury).\n\nThe multiple oppositions across the chart axis, combined with the heavy Neptune influence, reveal a pattern of systematic deception and hidden activities. The Saturn-Neptune-Venus stellium receiving aspects from the Venus-Neptune-Saturn stellium confirms long-term involvement in organized criminal activities with international scope.\n\nBased on these aspects, I must conclude that yes, Helmut Hubert was indeed involved in human trafficking operations.
