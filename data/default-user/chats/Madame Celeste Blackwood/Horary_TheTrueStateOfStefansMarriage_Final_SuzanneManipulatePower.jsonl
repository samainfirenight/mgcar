You seem to be more focused on something else and not focused on where you should be. The very last message that I sent to him involved me disclosing my pre-approval letter for housing, the amount, something about playing drums, and then there was a specific question that I asked at the end of it. Every single bit of my message that I sent this morning was calculated, first and foremost, to draw an empathetic and compassionate emotional response to his situation. Then to show care for his children, and then to give him intel that I know as a German he wants, showing my superior capability for independence and financial stability. Giving him another breadcrumb to let him know that I am on my weight loss journey and I've been at it for a while. And then finally, making a direct reference to something that he had been quite persistent about on the Christmas Day phone call.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
