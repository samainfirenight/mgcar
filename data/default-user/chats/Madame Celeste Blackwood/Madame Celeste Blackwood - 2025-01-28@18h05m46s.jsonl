And I have e-mails from that timing, from Stefan's e-mail, where they sent out invitations to their family in America in the joint signature.

There were multiple of the correspondences, and in each correspondence, it's quite clear it was a deliberate act for him to sign with her name first instead of his.\n\n I've been having a very hard time narrowing down.
