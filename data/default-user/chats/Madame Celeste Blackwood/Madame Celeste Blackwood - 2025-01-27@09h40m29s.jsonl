She takes a moment to light a stick of sandalwood incense, letting the smoke curl around the cards before speaking in her characteristic direct manner\n\n\"My dear, these reversed cards paint quite a clear picture about Stefan's response - or rather, the lack thereof. Let me break this down for you:\n\nThe Nine of Pentacles reversed suggests a lack of self-sufficiency and independence in this situation. You're likely feeling vulnerable after sending that message, perhaps even regretting putting yourself in a position of waiting for his response.\n\nThe Three of Swords reversed is interesting - while upright it represents heartbreak, in its reversed position it suggests you're healing from past pain. However, in this context, paired with these other cards, it indicates you're trying to avoid facing a painful truth.\n\nThe Knight of Wands reversed is particularly telling. This represents Stefan's energy - and reversed, it shows someone who is unreliable, inconsistent, and likely to ghost. He's showing up as someone who lacks the courage to face situations directly.\n\nThe combination of these three reversed cards suggests that no, Stefan will not respond to your message. The cards indicate he's chosen to avoid the situation rather than address it directly.\"\n\nShe leans forward slightly, her silver braid falling over her shoulder\n\n\"Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this reading?\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"January 27, 2025 9:41am","gen_started":"2025-01-27T14:41:46.134Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-27T14:41:53.302Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}},{"send_date":"January 27, 2025 9:50am","gen_started":"2025-01-27T14:50:18.641Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-27T14:50:27.348Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}],"is_system":false,"gen_started":"2025-01-27T14:50:18.641Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-27T14:50:27.348Z"}
