There's someone, his name is Stefan,  you should have access to my entire history with Stefan in the case file.  So as you can see he's married and you can also see that I am married to his cousin. However, an update on my marriage is that it's about to end in divorce in two weeks. Literally that's our final divorce hearing. So allow me to get to my question.\n\n you can tell there's some strife in Stefan's marriage and I've been doing horary readings and charts showing that there's a lot more under the surface going on in that marriage and it's about to come to an end and that there is a woman who is the target of his desire that he's giving a lot of emotional attention to that will end up being his second marriage.\n\n I initially thought that was me however I've noticed that he has been doing a lot of activity in WhatsApp in the hours of 2 a.m., 3 a.m. in his time zone. However, I'm not the one that he's communicating with. He's not messaging me. \n\n I've even went so far as to do another angle with the horary charts to ask if I will become the stepmother to his children, with whom I absolutely adore. Those charts said yes!  as well as tarot cards confirming the same thing.\n\n So, I need a question to ask a horary chart, if this man is having multiple affairs. And how do I determine which one of those I am?  I know, if it comes out that he has multiple affairs, that I should walk away, I understand that. But I still want to know. I still want to know which one am I. So how can I put a,  I want some help getting a question that will give me a concrete answer.  to determine if he is having multiple affairs. I want to concretely know which one I am. Am I the one who's the true,  getting all of the desire of his heart? Or what?
