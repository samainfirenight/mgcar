Married to a female, approximately same age, for seven years. She's also a native of Germany, but not exactly sure if it's Munich or not.  Not sure, but possible submissive tendencies in the male as we've seen that he took the female's surname in marriage instead of the traditional taking of the male's surname and written correspondence with joint signatures. He takes deliberate action to put the female's name first.\n\n That being said, although I can't give you much, we have sent our affiliate in to establish a friendship with Undertones of Romance. And after five months of careful and sporadic communication, when our affiliate Melissa made direct reference to what we believed was an expression of his feelings through a metaphor, he is denying it.

You know, there are many, many people in my personal network. I write less often than you. I hope you understand that. It is really not mean at all, but I cannot make it happen. Too many things at the same time. Thanks and all the best.\"\n\n13:12h Munich Time - Melissa: \"Thank you for getting back with me and it means a lot to know that you're not intentionally trying to hurt me or create distance. Yes, I do understand. Perhaps if you're willing we could structure something together that could help us both because I gather that, especially with the risk you took on the movie suggestion, I'm as important to you as you are to me. I know I can be quite intense and I have a propensity for overthinking things. Honestly, this is why I wanted to talk to you about my autism and I asked for a phone call twice. Although high functioning, the autism is still there and it has its effects. It also comes with extreme and rapid oxytocin fluctuations. So maybe we can structure something that's mindful of that and mindful of your schedule. Because I think you know I don't want to lose you, and after our phone call on Christmas Day, I know you don't want to lose me either. You took a big risk by telling me that, and I'm sorry for missing the cue, but I think we can work with this since we're on the same page. So perhaps let's find a way to meet it in the middle. Would you be willing to structure something that works for us both? And please, I know you're busy. If you can't formulate a meaningful response right now, at least let me know if you agree, and you can give me a better response later. It will certainly help me from overthinking things.\"\n\n13:17h Munich Time - Stefan: \"To be honest, the message sounds kind of too complicated to me. You know what the best thing is that I write to you whenever I have the feeling and the time. E. g, with Ed (my cousin) there were times we did not have contact for years. But this has no effect on my relationship to Ed. And the movie's suggestion had NO intention at all. I just watched it short before, I like it, and since you and Ed were at the airport when we called, it came to my mind. No deeper meaning at all. So I hope you understand that, and I really wish you all the best on your house bid. Enjoy the day! Cheers.\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1717726015299-Chief.png"}
