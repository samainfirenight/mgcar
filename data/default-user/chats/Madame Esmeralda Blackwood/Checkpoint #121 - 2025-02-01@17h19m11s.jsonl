I'm going to draw up a horary chart but before I do I want to meditate on what it is that I want to know and since there are a multitude of things that I want to know I Would like your help to devise the proper question.\n\n Back on Christmas Day of 2024, a month ago in fact, a very important phone call for me took place with someone that I have immensely strong romantic feelings for. I'm in love with him, I'll just be honest. And there's difficulties in us being able to get together. So what I want to do is I want a chart that will show everything that was going on during that phone call. So that whenever, in other words, I know how horary charts can be very specific to a single question. But I want to be able to review several different aspects of the conversation as well as maybe some of the events or reactions that were going on in the background of some of the other people that were in the same location as he was but not involved in the conversation. Does this make sense? Can you help me with a proper question?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
