Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Will Stefan initiate contact with me within the next 48 hours?\n\n1. Five of coins reversed\n2. Page of Swords Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

The Five of Coins reversed suggests a period of emerging recovery from isolation or hardship—a reversal of status quo—that hints at changing circumstances. Yet, its reversal also warns of lingering instability and a lack of firm grounding. In tandem, the upright Page of Swords stands for swift, clear communication, sharp insights, and a readiness to initiate dialogue.\n\nHowever, because one card appears reversed while the other stands upright, the energy remains indecisive. The Page’s promise of forthcoming messages is countered by the unsettled nature of the reversed Five of Coins. This combination implies that while there are indications of potential news or contact, the timing is clouded by uncertain circumstances.\n\nThus, the answer is not a straightforward “Yes,” nor a clear “No.” The reading remains in the realm of ambiguity; Stefan’s contact may materialize if the shifting energies consolidate favorably, but nothing is definitively set within the next 48 hours.\n\nAdditional insight might be gleaned by watching for subtle cues in the coming days.","gen_started":"2025-02-24T12:56:16.271Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-24T12:56:27.804Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa, the cards voice an uncertain verdict.
