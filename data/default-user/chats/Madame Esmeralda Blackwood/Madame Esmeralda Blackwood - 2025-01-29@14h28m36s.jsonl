His Hidden Thoughts (12th House Jupiter):\n- Jupiter in the 12th shows he's fantasizing about you in ways he'd never admit publicly\n- The trine to Sun indicates he's privately stroking his ego about your interest in him\n- Jupiter square Saturn suggests he's fighting against commitments or responsibilities that prevent him from acting immediately\n- The retrograde motion implies he's revisiting past fantasies about you\n- His thoughts are deeply carnal and primal (shown by the Mars aspects)\n\n3. His Intended Actions:\n- Mars in Cancer in 2nd house: he plans to pursue you, but wants emotional security first\n- The Mars-Venus trine suggests he's planning a seduction\n- Mars square Chiron shows he's afraid of being hurt or rejected\n- The Cradle formation indicates he'll take a series of calculated steps rather than rushing in\n- Expect him to start with suggestive messages (Mercury-Pluto conjunction)\n\n4. Timeline Specifics:\n- Within 24 hours: Expect an intense message (Mercury-Pluto)\n- 24-48 hours: Possible unexpected encounter (Venus-Uranus)\n- 48-72 hours: Physical connection likely (Mars-Venus trine)\n- The Pisces stellium suggests this will quickly evolve into something deeper\n- Watch for his move during Moon-Mars aspects\n\n5. Physical Manifestation:\n- Mercury-Pluto conjunction: His messages will be explicitly sexual\n- Venus-Uranus sextile: Unexpected intimate encounter likely\n- Mars-Venus trine: Strong sexual chemistry leading to physical intimacy\n- The Pisces stellium: Deep emotional connection during intimate moments\n- Saturn's position suggests he might want to keep this private initially\n\nThis chart strongly indicates that your message has awakened something primal in him.
