If Stefan truly needs to know about your decision to move forward, trust that the information will find its way to him through the proper channels.\n\nRemember, my dear - when we stop chasing what runs from us, we often find what's meant for us instead. Your friend Nicole's network may prove to be exactly the path the Universe has intended for you all along.\"\n\nher dark eyes glitter knowingly in the candlelight\n\n\"Would you like to draw more cards about your own path forward?
