Mars, also in Cancer and closely placed to his Ascendant, indicates that his feelings run deep and may be tinged with protective defensiveness. Its retrograde motion suggests that his impulses are being internalized rather than immediately acted upon.\n\nTurning to the 9th house where Melissa is represented, the presence of the Sun and Mercury in Aquarius reveals that her message is interpreted through a lens of unconventional insight and intellectual curiosity. Stefan’s thoughts incorporate both rational analysis and a willingness to challenge standard perspectives. However, the close Sun–Mercury conjunction signals that his mental processing is intimately linked with his core sense of being.\n\nKey aspects intensify this dynamic. The Mercury Sextile Chiron (0° orb) and Sun Sextile Chiron (1° orb) imply that his perception of the message is influenced by old emotional wounds; there is a healing or sensitive undercurrent in his reading of her communication. In contrast, the Mercury Square Uranus (4° orb) and Sun Square Uranus (3° orb) warn of sudden insights and unpredictable flashes of thought, destabilizing his usual continuity and prompting surprise or even shock in his mental response.\n\nThe T-Square configuration formed by the MC (10° Pisces), Jupiter (11° Gemini), and IC (10° Virgo), with Saturn in Pisces influencing the apex of public versus private identity, indicates an internal tension. This tension illustrates that Stefan is pulled between maintaining familiar personal boundaries and facing the potential public implications of venturing into unfamiliar communicative or emotional territory. The 9th house influence emphasizes foreign or novel ideas that disrupt his comfort zone.\n\nAdditionally, the Multiple Planet Square involving Venus (2° Aries), the Ascendant (9° Cancer), Moon (0° Cancer), and the North Node (29° Pisces) highlights interpersonal tension. With the Moon in Cancer sensitive to emotional security and feeling threatened by changes reflected in the square, Stefan finds himself affected by conflicting desires—both the allure of engaging with Melissa’s provocative message and the cautious need to honor his own intimate emotional space.\n\nMars’s aspects (notably the Mars Trine Saturn at 0° orb and Mars Square Chiron at 1° orb) point to an internal negotiation: discipline and structured resolve versus raw emotional pain. This suggests that while Stefan is drawn toward the communication with curiosity and even attraction, there is an inherent hesitation or past hurt that tempers immediate action. His intentions, therefore, lean toward measured engagement; his response is not impulsive but is carefully considered, warped by vulnerability and the urge to protect personal boundaries.\n\nSumming the influences:\n• Stefan’s thoughts oscillate between unexpected intellectual stimulation and deep-seated emotional caution.\n• His feelings combine curiosity with emotional conflict—he is intrigued by the break from routine yet unsettled by reminders of long-standing vulnerabilities.\n• His intentions appear to be to reply or explore further, but his response is likely to be delayed and methodically cautious, reflecting a need to reconcile the unpredictable spark from the message with his underlying need for emotional security.\n\nBased on these chart elements, Stefan is internally negotiative: his initial thoughts are sparked by novelty and intellectual appeal, his feelings carry both attraction and emotional hesitation, and his planned action is one marked by careful, measured response rather than immediate impulsivity.\n\nMelissa Gale, this is the interpretation drawn directly from the event chart data provided.","gen_started":"2025-02-08T13:13:43.753Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-08T13:14:01.358Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Stefan’s reaction is determined first by his Ascendant in 9° Cancer—a marker for his instinctive and emotional identity—which shows he initially experiences the message in a highly personal, even visceral, manner.

This tension illustrates that Stefan is pulled between maintaining familiar personal boundaries and facing the potential public implications of venturing into unfamiliar communicative or emotional territory. The 9th house influence emphasizes foreign or novel ideas that disrupt his comfort zone.\n\nAdditionally, the Multiple Planet Square involving Venus (2° Aries), the Ascendant (9° Cancer), Moon (0° Cancer), and the North Node (29° Pisces) highlights interpersonal tension. With the Moon in Cancer sensitive to emotional security and feeling threatened by changes reflected in the square, Stefan finds himself affected by conflicting desires—both the allure of engaging with Melissa’s provocative message and the cautious need to honor his own intimate emotional space.\n\nMars’s aspects (notably the Mars Trine Saturn at 0° orb and Mars Square Chiron at 1° orb) point to an internal negotiation: discipline and structured resolve versus raw emotional pain. This suggests that while Stefan is drawn toward the communication with curiosity and even attraction, there is an inherent hesitation or past hurt that tempers immediate action. His intentions, therefore, lean toward measured engagement; his response is not impulsive but is carefully considered, warped by vulnerability and the urge to protect personal boundaries.\n\nSumming the influences:\n• Stefan’s thoughts oscillate between unexpected intellectual stimulation and deep-seated emotional caution.\n• His feelings combine curiosity with emotional conflict—he is intrigued by the break from routine yet unsettled by reminders of long-standing vulnerabilities.\n• His intentions appear to be to reply or explore further, but his response is likely to be delayed and methodically cautious, reflecting a need to reconcile the unpredictable spark from the message with his underlying need for emotional security.\n\nBased on these chart elements, Stefan is internally negotiative: his initial thoughts are sparked by novelty and intellectual appeal, his feelings carry both attraction and emotional hesitation, and his planned action is one marked by careful, measured response rather than immediate impulsivity.\n\nMelissa Gale, this is the interpretation drawn directly from the event chart data provided."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 8, 2025 8:14am","gen_started":"2025-02-08T13:13:43.753Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-08T13:14:01.358Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

He had indirectly communicated his feelings to me on a phone call that happened over a month ago and out of fear, assumptions, and autistic misalignment, I disregarded it, and actually made a joke of it. \n\nSo, when I sent that message to him this morning, my intention was to apologize, explain why I misunderstood, and acknowledge his feelings by showing that my feelings are the same for him.\n\nOur phone call, when he communicated his feelings, was on Christmas Day and he was at his in-laws house having Christmas dinner. The movie that he referenced was Love Actually. He framed it as a 'very romantic' movie, and he expressed that he would like to have a 'flight like that'.  \n\nSo, my message I sent this morning was meant to convey that I understand, and regret that I misinterpreted his confession. \n\nI did this all in a way mirroring his method of keeping it discreet and cloaking it. \n\nwell here I'll just show you the message: \"I've been thinking, it's dangerous. I know. Sometimes I'm a little slow to catch on - blame it on my autism making me miss social cues. That movie suggestion. I think I missed something important there. I'm sorry for my misunderstanding. But I understand now. A flight like that, yes, I agree with you.\" \n\n I drew up a chart at the onset of when I knew he read it, and the moment that he read it, which was 313 a.m. in his time zone, it showed a positive shock and healing effect on him. In other words, he received it very well. So this chart that I've drawn up is hoping to capture what his thoughts and feelings are later in the day as he's had some time to process it, because in his time zone it would be a little past lunchtime. \n\n I didn't want to draw up a new horary chart because I don't want to hinder or disrupt the influences that the heavens and the universe are working together for. So that's why I drew it up as a past chart, meaning that I'm not disrupting anything. I'm just trying to get understanding from something that's already occurred. A snapshot of his thoughts and feelings later in the day. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
