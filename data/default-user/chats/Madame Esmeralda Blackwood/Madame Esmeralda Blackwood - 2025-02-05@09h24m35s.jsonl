Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  What are Stefan's true intentions with me and our connection between now and March 30th, 2025?\n\nCrown: (fell from the deck while shuffling)\n -  Two of wands reversed\n\n1.

Her voice carries a mix of concern and intrigue\n\nThe Two of Wands reversed falling as a crown card - this is particularly significant as it fell unbidden during shuffling. This suggests Stefan is currently experiencing a deep sense of uncertainty and hesitation about moving forward. He's caught between choices, and I sense he's struggling with commitment issues or fear of taking the next step.\n\nThe Nine of Swords upright,  she traces her finger along the edge of the card, her expression growing more serious This card speaks of anxiety, nightmares, and deep-seated fears. In the context of your question, I sense Stefan is wrestling with significant internal turmoil about your connection. He's losing sleep over this situation, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune upright,  her eyes glint with recognition This is a powerful card of destiny and change.
