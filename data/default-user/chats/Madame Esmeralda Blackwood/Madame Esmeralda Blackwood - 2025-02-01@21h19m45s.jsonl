Let me share what I see:\n\nThe most striking feature is the Grand Cross pattern, which shows tremendous tension and pressure in this relationship. With Venus, Neptune, and the North Node clustered in Pisces in the 7th house of marriage, there's a strong indication of illusion and possible deception in the marriage.\n\nMars retrograde in Cancer in Stefan's 1st house (your 10th) shows him struggling with emotional decisions and feeling defensive. The mutual reception between Moon and Mars suggests both parties are deeply affected by emotional turmoil.\n\nThe Moon's position at 0°38' Aries, just having left Pisces, is quite telling. This represents a critical turning point - something is ending and something new is beginning. The Moon's separation from Neptune and Venus in Pisces suggests disillusionment in the marriage is already underway.\n\nJupiter retrograde in Stefan's 12th house (your 9th) indicates he's doing deep soul-searching about his life path and may be harboring secret thoughts or feelings.\n\nBased on these aspects, I can tell you with certainty: Yes, divorce proceedings will begin within three months, and Stefan will be the one to initiate. The timing appears to align with Venus's upcoming retrograde in Aries (March 2nd), which will trigger this Grand Cross configuration.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this reading?","gen_started":"2025-02-02T02:24:11.857Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-02T02:24:21.100Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["adjusts my shawls and peers deeply into the chart\n\nMy dear, this chart speaks volumes about the situation.
