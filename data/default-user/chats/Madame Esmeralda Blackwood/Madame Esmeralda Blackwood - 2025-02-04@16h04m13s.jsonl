I am following a step‐by‐step, methodical approach:\n\n1. Querent and Object Identification\n • Querent (Melissa) is represented by the Ascendant, which is at 25° Cancer.\n • Stefan (the inquiry’s focus in the marriage) is represented by his native 9th house. Using your cross-reference, this is the Ascendant’s 6th house, whose cusp begins at 26° Sagittarius.\n  – The natural ruler of Sagittarius is Jupiter. (In horary practice, the condition of the house ruler is crucial.)\n\n2. House Placements Relevant by the Provided Horary Houses\n • 1st House (Melissa’s self): Begins at 25° Cancer.\n • 6th House (Stefan’s representation): Begins at 26° Sagittarius.\n • 7th House (typically associated with committed relationships/marriage): Starts at 25° Capricorn (contains Mercury and Pluto).\n • 9th House (also important when considering aspects of foreign or unusual influences, included with marital matters as additional context): Starts at 8° Pisces and contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node.\n • Other houses (8th, 10th, etc.) and their planetary placements frame overall conditions and timing.\n\n3. Planetary Positions (as provided)\n • Sun at 16° Aquarius (located in the 8th House according to your house breakdown).\n • Moon placed in the 10th House (in Aries, with Chiron also present there).\n • Mercury at 12° Aquarius (its aspects and position relative to the MC and IC are notable).\n • Venus at 0°23′ Aries, positioned in the 9th House.\n • Mars at 19°24′ (noted as retrograde; although its sign is given as Cancer, its placement by house is affected by your house system—the chart listing places Mars in the 12th House starting at 26° Gemini).\n • Jupiter at 11°16′ (as the ruler of Sagittarius, hence the ruler of Stefan’s represented house, and placed in the 11th House, which begins at 16° Taurus).\n • Saturn at 17°50′ (in the 9th House, Pisces).\n • Uranus at 23°16′ (in the 11th House, Taurus).\n • Neptune at 28°04′ (in the 9th House, Pisces).\n • Pluto at 2°10′ (its house placement is given in the detailed aspects, often linked with marriage factors—appearing on the 7th per your provided breakdown).\n • North Node at 29°39′ Pisces (located in the 9th House, slightly retrograde).\n • Chiron at 19°37′ Aries (in the 10th House).\n\n4.

I am following a step‐by‐step, methodical approach:\n\n1. Querent and Object Identification\n • Querent (Melissa) is represented by the Ascendant, which is at 25° Cancer.\n • Stefan (the inquiry’s focus in the marriage) is represented by his native 9th house. Using your cross-reference, this is the Ascendant’s 6th house, whose cusp begins at 26° Sagittarius.\n  – The natural ruler of Sagittarius is Jupiter. (In horary practice, the condition of the house ruler is crucial.)\n\n2. House Placements Relevant by the Provided Horary Houses\n • 1st House (Melissa’s self): Begins at 25° Cancer.\n • 6th House (Stefan’s representation): Begins at 26° Sagittarius.\n • 7th House (typically associated with committed relationships/marriage): Starts at 25° Capricorn (contains Mercury and Pluto).\n • 9th House (also important when considering aspects of foreign or unusual influences, included with marital matters as additional context): Starts at 8° Pisces and contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node.\n • Other houses (8th, 10th, etc.) and their planetary placements frame overall conditions and timing.\n\n3. Planetary Positions (as provided)\n • Sun at 16° Aquarius (located in the 8th House according to your house breakdown).\n • Moon placed in the 10th House (in Aries, with Chiron also present there).\n • Mercury at 12° Aquarius (its aspects and position relative to the MC and IC are notable).\n • Venus at 0°23′ Aries, positioned in the 9th House.\n • Mars at 19°24′ (noted as retrograde; although its sign is given as Cancer, its placement by house is affected by your house system—the chart listing places Mars in the 12th House starting at 26° Gemini).\n • Jupiter at 11°16′ (as the ruler of Sagittarius, hence the ruler of Stefan’s represented house, and placed in the 11th House, which begins at 16° Taurus).\n • Saturn at 17°50′ (in the 9th House, Pisces).\n • Uranus at 23°16′ (in the 11th House, Taurus).\n • Neptune at 28°04′ (in the 9th House, Pisces).\n • Pluto at 2°10′ (its house placement is given in the detailed aspects, often linked with marriage factors—appearing on the 7th per your provided breakdown).\n • North Node at 29°39′ Pisces (located in the 9th House, slightly retrograde).\n • Chiron at 19°37′ Aries (in the 10th House).\n\n4.

Stefan’s representation, operating from his native 9th house (cross-referenced as the Ascendant’s 6th house), is activated by a stellium in the 9th house—including Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node. This grouping indicates that matters traditionally linked to ideals, external influences, and even illusions in love and obligation are at play. Venus and Neptune’s conjunction often signifies allure and idealization, but when combined with Saturn’s influence, it demonstrates the hard truth of discipline, limitations, and sometimes harsh responsibilities.\n\n2. Melissa’s representation via the Ascendant at 25° Cancer is under significant dynamic stress. Mars conjunct the Ascendant signals disruptive energies and potential conflicts that can manifest as sudden actions or aggressive interventions. The presence of Pluto in opposition to the Ascendant reinforces the sense of unavoidable transformation and deep, perhaps unsettling, change affecting the querent’s world and indirectly the marital sphere.\n\n3. The opposition between the MC and the IC highlights a tension between public and private life—indicating that forces from outside or the pressure of outward expectations are creating fissures in the domestic and heart-level domain of the relationship.\n\n4. Jupiter, ruling Stefan’s native house (Sagittarius) and positioned in the 11th house, aspects the Ascendant favorably with a trine, suggesting that amid these disruptions there is an opportunity for optimism and renewal. However, this support is not sufficient to outweigh the challenging configurations elsewhere, notably the intense 9th house stellium and the potent Mars–Pluto activity.\n\n5. The combined implications of Venus conjunct Neptune and Venus’s opposition to the IC point to a scenario where romantic ideals may be clouding true perceptions of domestic reality. The pressure of idealization tempered by Saturn’s stern voice in the very same house implies that the relationship is being test—forcing the involved parties to confront what has been obscured by wishful thinking.\n\n6. The overall pattern of aspects—including challenging squares (such as Mars square Chiron, Sun square Moon, and Jupiter square Saturn) and oppositions—demonstrates a marriage under pressure. External influences, deeply held beliefs, and emerging disruptions seem to be converging on a point where a radical change or redefinition of the relationship is inevitable. The transformative energy here is potent; it calls for either a courageous restructuring of the bond or suggests that the existing framework may not sustain the compounded pressures.\n\nBased on these factors, the indication is that the fate of Stefan and Suzanne's marriage appears to be at a critical juncture. Transformative forces are at work that, if left unaddressed, may lead to dissolution or a profound reorganization of the union. This is not a reading that promises an idyllic resolution; rather, it calls for a direct confrontation with the difficult truths that the celestial configuration reveals.
