At the crown, the Page of Pentacles upright signals an emerging message—a call to observe practical details and remain open to learning—while the Wheel of Fortune reversed indicates an unsettled period in her life, perhaps a disruption of her usual pattern or a tendency to resist change.\n\nIn the body of your spread, The Hanged Man upright calls for a pause and a shift in perspective. It suggests that from a higher vantage the situation might reveal itself differently, urging patience and reflective observation rather than impulsive conclusions. The Nine of Swords reversed speaks of a lessening of anxiety or worry; it seems that the tensions and fears you may have sensed are subsiding, hinting that the emotional turmoil surrounding her situation might be a product more of perception than of a concrete reality.\n\nThe Queen of Wands reversed intimates a departure from her usual vibrant, self-assured nature. This could point to personal inner conflicts, perhaps a sense of imbalance or diminished confidence. Yet this energy does not automatically solidify into evidence of an extramarital affair; it may simply underscore personal challenges or even a reaction to feeling misunderstood or constrained in her current environment. Finally, the Four of Swords upright counsels a period of rest and recovery—a time to step back from over-analysis and allow clarity to emerge naturally.\n\nBased on these elements, the reading does not affirm that Suzanne is actively engaged in an extramarital affair. The cards lean more toward a depiction of inner upheaval, a time of transition, and a call for calm reflection. It advises considering that challenges in her current state might be misinterpreted as external betrayal when they could in fact be internal struggles calling for healing and balance.\n\nIf further insight is needed, additional inquiry into the specifics of her actions and context may help clarify these energies further.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T01:25:27.994Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T01:25:39.503Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa, the cards convey a subtle, nuanced message rather than a definitive confirmation of betrayal.
