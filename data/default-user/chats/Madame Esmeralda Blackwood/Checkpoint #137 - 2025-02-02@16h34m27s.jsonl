House and Cusp Details\n • Ascendant (Self/Melissa): 10° Virgo\n • 3rd House (Stefan’s representation): Begins at 1° Scorpio\n\n2. Key Planetary Positions and Rulerships\n • Mars (ruler of Scorpio for Stefan) is located in the 11th House in Cancer.\n • Mercury (ruler of Virgo for Melissa) is in Aquarius in the 6th House.\n • The Sun, Mercury, and Pluto occupy the 5th House (14° Capricorn cusp).\n • Moon, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node occupy the 7th House (beginning at 10° Pisces).\n • Chiron is in the 8th House (3° Aries).\n • Uranus is in the 9th House (1° Taurus).\n • Jupiter is in the 10th House (6° Gemini).\n\n3. Major Aspects Involving Key Planets\n • Mars (Stefan’s significator) forms:\n  – A square with Chiron (orb ~1°), which may indicate painful or conflicted reactions.\n  – A sextile with Uranus (orb ~3°), suggesting sudden or unexpected influences.\n  – A trine with Saturn (orb ~3°), implying structure or restraint in his response.\n  – A trine with Neptune (orb ~7°) and is also in aspect via Venus trine Mars (orb ~7°), which can suggest an overlay of idealism or confusion.\n • Mercury (Melissa’s significator) forms:\n  – A conjunction with Pluto in the 5th House (orb ~4°), linking the inquiry to intense personal transformation.\n  – A sextile with the IC (orb 0°) and a trine with the MC (orb 0°), connecting the chart’s foundational and public points.\n  – A trine with Jupiter (orb ~5°), suggesting broader, optimistic context.\n • The Moon, in Pisces in the 7th House, has:\n  – A conjunction with Saturn (orb ~2°) and\n  – An opposition to the Ascendant (orb ~5°), highlighting interpersonal tension.\n  – A square with Jupiter (orb ~4°) contributing to dynamic emotional interplay.\n\n4.

Additional Notable Features\n • The moon phase at the time was a waxing crescent.\n • Most aspects (trines and sextiles) occur within a total of nine, providing a generally flowing energy backdrop.\n • Neptune in Pisces (placed in the 7th) is the sole dispositor, underscoring the influence of Piscean dynamics in interpersonal matters.\n\nThis is the data set as extracted from the horary chart using traditional horary methods, focusing on the significators for Melissa (Ascendant/Mercury) and Stefan (3rd house/Mars) along with key structural and aspectual details.","gen_started":"2025-02-02T21:39:07.206Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-02T21:39:28.994Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a listing of the pertinent horary data gathered from the chart, following traditional horary principles and taking into account that Melissa is represented by the Ascendant and Stefan by the 3rd house.
