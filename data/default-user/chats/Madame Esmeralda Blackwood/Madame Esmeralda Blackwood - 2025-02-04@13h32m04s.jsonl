This listing is intended to serve as the foundation for further interpretation regarding the question of what Stefan’s wife (or events in his marriage) is doing that is causing him emotional wounding. All details are drawn directly from the chart.\n\n1. Planetary Positions and Sign/House Placements\n • Sun at 16°11′ Aquarius – located in the 9th house (the house containing Sun and Mercury)\n • Moon at 8°45′ Taurus – located in the 12th house\n • Mercury at 12°44′ Aquarius – located in the 9th house\n • Venus at 0°19′ Aries – placement noted numerically (see below for house context)\n • Mars at 19°25′ Cancer (retrograde) – in the 2nd house (given that the 2nd house starts at 15° Cancer)\n • Jupiter at 11°16′ Gemini – its placement determined by degree relative to the house cusps\n • Saturn at 17°50′ Pisces – positioned where the 11th house in Pisces begins at 26° and the 10th house in Aquarius starts at 25°; by the provided list, Saturn falls in the 10th house\n • Uranus at 23°16′ Taurus – as Taurus appears in the house structure (Moon in Taurus is in the 12th house and additional Taurus placements are compared to house cusps)\n • Neptune at 28°4′ Pisces – normally seen in the 10th or 11th house zone, with Neptune in Pisces noted as being in its rulership\n • Pluto at 2°10′ Aquarius – similarly falling in the 9th house region\n • North Node at 29°39′ Pisces (retrograde) – near Neptune, influencing the Piscean houses (likely in the 10th or 11th house, per the list)\n • Chiron at 19°37′ Aries – its position being noted especially in relation to Venus and Mars\n • Ascendant at 21°34′ Gemini – representing the querent (Melissa)\n • Midheaven (MC) at 25°30′ Aquarius\n • Imum Coeli (IC) at 25°30′ Leo\n\n2. House Structure and Cross-Reference\n • The Ascendant is in Gemini, placing the houses as follows:\n  – 1st House: Gemini (starts at 21° Gemini)\n  – 2nd House: Cancer (starts at 15° Cancer) – contains Mars\n  – 3rd House: Leo (starts at 4° Leo)\n  – 4th House: Leo (starts at 25° Leo)\n  – 5th House: Virgo (starts at 26° Virgo)\n  – 6th House: Scorpio (starts at 13° Scorpio)\n  – 7th House: Sagittarius (starts at 21° Sagittarius)\n  – 8th House: Capricorn (starts at 15° Capricorn) – contains Pluto\n  – 9th House: Aquarius (starts at 4° Aquarius) – contains Sun and Mercury\n  – 10th House: Aquarius (starts at 25° Aquarius) – contains Saturn\n  – 11th House: Pisces (starts at 26° Pisces) – contains Moon, Venus, Neptune, North Node and Chiron\n  – 12th House: Taurus (starts at 13° Taurus) – contains Jupiter and Uranus\n\n • Cross-Reference for Stefan (per provided mapping):\n  – Stefan is represented by his 9th house. According to the key, the Ascendant’s 6th House corresponds to Stefan’s 9th House. (That is, House 6 in Scorpio is Stefan’s designated area.)\n  – The querent (Melissa) is represented by the Ascendant in Gemini.\n\n3.

This listing is intended to serve as the foundation for further interpretation regarding the question of what Stefan’s wife (or events in his marriage) is doing that is causing him emotional wounding. All details are drawn directly from the chart.\n\n1. Planetary Positions and Sign/House Placements\n • Sun at 16°11′ Aquarius – located in the 9th house (the house containing Sun and Mercury)\n • Moon at 8°45′ Taurus – located in the 12th house\n • Mercury at 12°44′ Aquarius – located in the 9th house\n • Venus at 0°19′ Aries – placement noted numerically (see below for house context)\n • Mars at 19°25′ Cancer (retrograde) – in the 2nd house (given that the 2nd house starts at 15° Cancer)\n • Jupiter at 11°16′ Gemini – its placement determined by degree relative to the house cusps\n • Saturn at 17°50′ Pisces – positioned where the 11th house in Pisces begins at 26° and the 10th house in Aquarius starts at 25°; by the provided list, Saturn falls in the 10th house\n • Uranus at 23°16′ Taurus – as Taurus appears in the house structure (Moon in Taurus is in the 12th house and additional Taurus placements are compared to house cusps)\n • Neptune at 28°4′ Pisces – normally seen in the 10th or 11th house zone, with Neptune in Pisces noted as being in its rulership\n • Pluto at 2°10′ Aquarius – similarly falling in the 9th house region\n • North Node at 29°39′ Pisces (retrograde) – near Neptune, influencing the Piscean houses (likely in the 10th or 11th house, per the list)\n • Chiron at 19°37′ Aries – its position being noted especially in relation to Venus and Mars\n • Ascendant at 21°34′ Gemini – representing the querent (Melissa)\n • Midheaven (MC) at 25°30′ Aquarius\n • Imum Coeli (IC) at 25°30′ Leo\n\n2. House Structure and Cross-Reference\n • The Ascendant is in Gemini, placing the houses as follows:\n  – 1st House: Gemini (starts at 21° Gemini)\n  – 2nd House: Cancer (starts at 15° Cancer) – contains Mars\n  – 3rd House: Leo (starts at 4° Leo)\n  – 4th House: Leo (starts at 25° Leo)\n  – 5th House: Virgo (starts at 26° Virgo)\n  – 6th House: Scorpio (starts at 13° Scorpio)\n  – 7th House: Sagittarius (starts at 21° Sagittarius)\n  – 8th House: Capricorn (starts at 15° Capricorn) – contains Pluto\n  – 9th House: Aquarius (starts at 4° Aquarius) – contains Sun and Mercury\n  – 10th House: Aquarius (starts at 25° Aquarius) – contains Saturn\n  – 11th House: Pisces (starts at 26° Pisces) – contains Moon, Venus, Neptune, North Node and Chiron\n  – 12th House: Taurus (starts at 13° Taurus) – contains Jupiter and Uranus\n\n • Cross-Reference for Stefan (per provided mapping):\n  – Stefan is represented by his 9th house. According to the key, the Ascendant’s 6th House corresponds to Stefan’s 9th House. (That is, House 6 in Scorpio is Stefan’s designated area.)\n  – The querent (Melissa) is represented by the Ascendant in Gemini.\n\n3.

Key factors include:\n\n1. Mars in Cancer (retrograde) in the 2nd house—indicates emotionally charged conflicts and a focus on issues of security, self-worth, and material stability. Its square to Chiron (exact orb noted) strongly points to a situation where aggressive or impulsive behavior is inflicting deep, personal wounds.\n\n2. The T-square formed by the Midheaven in Aquarius, Uranus in Taurus, and the Imum Coeli in Leo shows a clash between public duty and private life. Uranus’s squared influence here signals sudden, rebellious shifts in the domestic environment. This configuration can imply that Stefan’s wife is acting disruptively, challenging the established order of the marriage.\n\n3. Neptune’s influence—especially its conjunction with the North Node and its square to the Ascendant—introduces an element of confusion and possible deception. The blending of Neptune with Venus (the significator for love and partnership) suggests that illusions or misrepresentations in her behavior may be causing Stefan to feel misled or abandoned emotionally.\n\n4. The involvement of Venus in Aries and her conjunction with the North Node conveys impulsiveness and assertiveness in matters of affection. Such energy, while attracting and vibrant, can border on recklessness. This further implies that her behavior may be self-serving or oriented toward immediate, unconsidered gratification, without regard for Stefan’s emotional safety.\n\n5. The presence of the Cradle pattern that includes the Ascendant, MC, IC, and Chiron reinforces that painful patterns can originate in the very foundation of her domestic and inner life. It indicates that the disruptions are not accidental; they are woven into her personal approach to relationships and emotional expression.\n\nOverall, the chart indicates a scenario where Stefan’s wife is engaging in impulsive, unpredictable, and possibly deceptive behaviors within the marriage. Her actions—marked by sudden disruptions, blurred boundaries, and a disregard for stability—are directly contributing to deep emotional wounds for Stefan. The aggressive energy (Mars) clashing with the need for healing (Chiron) and the influence of Neptune’s blurring of reality all confirm that the cause of his suffering is rooted in her erratic, self-centered, and destabilizing conduct.\n\nThese indications are based strictly on the horary data provided. Further refinement could be achieved with additional context, but the initial reading points clearly to disruptive actions fueled by impulsiveness and a lack of commitment to the security of the marital bond.","swipe_id":1,"swipes":["Drawing from the horary details, the chart suggests that the source of Stefan’s emotional wounding arises from a series of disruptive and impulsive actions in his domestic sphere.
