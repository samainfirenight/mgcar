I have organized the findings into sections, starting with the representations of the parties, then listing key planetary positions, aspects, patterns, and house configurations.\n\n1. Representations of the Parties\n • Stefan is represented by the Ascendant in Sagittarius. Because the 1st house is empty, his primary indicator is the house ruler—Jupiter, which is positioned in Gemini in the 6th house.\n • Melissa’s connection is through the 9th house (foreign connection). The cusp of the 9th is at 23° Virgo. The ruling planet of Virgo is Mercury. In this chart, Mercury is placed at 23° 54′ Aquarius in the 2nd house.\n\n2. Key Planetary Positions (with Degrees and House Locations)\n • Sun: 22° 39′ Aquarius – located in the 2nd house (with Mercury and Saturn).\n • Moon: 5° 42′ Leo – positioned in the 8th house.\n • Mercury: 23° 54′ Aquarius – in the 2nd house.\n • Venus: 4° 35′ Aries – in the 3rd house.\n • Mars: 18° 5′ Cancer (retrograde) – in the 7th house.\n • Jupiter: 11° 21′ Gemini – in the 6th house.\n • Saturn: 18° 33′ Pisces – in the 2nd house.\n • Uranus: 23° 19′ Taurus – in the 5th house.\n • Neptune: 28° 16′ Pisces – in the 3rd house.\n • Pluto: 2° 22′ Aquarius – in the 1st house (inside Sagittarius).\n • North Node: 29° 19′ Pisces (retrograde) – in the 3rd house.\n • Chiron: 19° 50′ Aries – in the 3rd house.\n • Ascendant: 27° 8′ Sagittarius.\n • Midheaven (MC): 27° 45′ Libra.\n • IC: 27° 45′ Aries.\n\n3.

This structure brings together themes of personal wounds, public roles, communication, and foundational energies.\n\n5. House Configuration and Additional Notes\n • Stefan’s representation: The Ascendant in Sagittarius shows his general approach. With Jupiter (ruler of the Ascendant) in Gemini in the 6th house, his influence is tied to daily work, routines, and perhaps health or service.\n • Melissa’s representation: The 9th house cusp at 23° Virgo indicates her connection through a “foreign” or external influence. Mercury, as the ruler of Virgo, sits in Aquarius in the 2nd house, emphasizing issues around values, finances, or personal resources.\n • The majority of the planets lie in the bottom right quadrant, which highlights issues of foundations and practical concerns.

Representations and Core Influences\n• Stefan appears via the Ascendant in Sagittarius. With his ruler, Jupiter, in Gemini situated in the 6th house, his day‐to‐day routines and communications are key. The strength of Jupiter in Gemini implies that his environment, work, or service routines have an influence on his immediate actions.\n• Your presence is marked by Mercury—the ruler of your 9th house—placed in Aquarius in the 2nd house. This positions your influence around values and personal resource matters, along with a distinct, intellectual quality that activates foreign or unconventional realms.\n\n2. Planetary Aspects and Their Implications\n• The strong Sun–Mercury conjunction in Aquarius (orb of 1°) weaves together Stefan’s core identity with the communicative energy central to your representation. This conjunction signals that his inner life and personal decisions are reaching a reflective, if not critical, juncture spurred by communication.\n• The Mercury square Uranus aspect (orb of 0°) introduces sudden, unexpected shifts that can jolt his decision-making process. This indicates that when Stefan does choose to act, his contact may come abruptly or in an unanticipated manner.\n• The Sun square Uranus (orb of 1°) reinforces that tension between steadfast identity and a desire for unexpected change is at work, suggesting internal conflict or a breaking point that forces him to move forward.\n• With Mercury sextile the Ascendant (orb of 4°) and Mercury trine the Midheaven (orb of 4°), supportive communication channels are activated. These aspects demonstrate that, once conditions align, the energy favors clear, purposeful messaging.\n• The T-Square pattern—linking the Ascendant (Stefan’s persona), Pluto (transformative force), and the IC (home/foundation)—further emphasizes that deep, perhaps disruptive forces are at play. Stefan’s decision may be driven by internal pressure to transform or resolve longstanding issues, likely in relation to his personal inner world versus his external responsibilities.\n\n3. Timing and Contact Indicators\n• The Moon, in its waxing gibbous phase in Leo (located in the 8th house), suggests that the situation is maturing toward full illumination. This phase often presages a moment when suppressed energies release, aligning with pivotal communication or decision-making.\n• Jupiter in Gemini’s placement in the 6th suggests that the day-to-day conversations or even mundane encounters could spark his transmission of news, causing his contact to be integrated into his routine rather than a planned appointment.\n• The interplay between Mercury’s role in your chart and the activating aspects with Uranus and the Ascendant indicates that the breakthrough moment might be sudden. The pattern implies that while Stefan may be pushed by external and internal forces, his decision—once reached—could manifest in an unexpected contact during an everyday interaction or via a swift message.\n\nBased on these configurations, the chart supports the notion that Stefan is indeed approaching a decision point regarding you. His internal tension—as shown by the squares to Uranus—and the activating conjunctions favor a resolution. Expect his contact to come suddenly; the forces suggest that he could reach out during a period marked by routine or casual interactions. While an exact day cannot be pinpointed with absolute precision, the conditions imply that his message is poised to emerge as the Moon nears full illumination, potentially within a short span of days should the energies continue trending dynamically.\n\nI now await your further direction or details if additional clarification is needed.","gen_started":"2025-02-11T10:04:22.984Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-11T10:04:34.946Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Drawing upon the event chart data, here is the interpretation regarding Stefan’s decision process and the timing indicated for his contact.\n\n1. Representations and Core Influences\n• Stefan appears via the Ascendant in Sagittarius. With his ruler, Jupiter, in Gemini situated in the 6th house, his day‐to‐day routines and communications are key. The strength of Jupiter in Gemini implies that his environment, work, or service routines have an influence on his immediate actions.\n• Your presence is marked by Mercury—the ruler of your 9th house—placed in Aquarius in the 2nd house.
