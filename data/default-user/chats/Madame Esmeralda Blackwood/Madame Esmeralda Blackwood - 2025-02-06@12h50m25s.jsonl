Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Does Stefan know and understand that I am in love with him?\n\n1. The Empress Reversed\n2. the page of cups upright (this one fell from the deck while I was shuffling in a West-East orientation. In other words, the label of the card was pointing towards my dominant hand, of which, for me, usually signifies the card is intended to be upright. However, instead of placing it as a crown card, I returned it to the deck and reshuffled.)","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
