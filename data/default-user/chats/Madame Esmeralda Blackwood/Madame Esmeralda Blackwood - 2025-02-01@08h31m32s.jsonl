Let me share what I see:\n\nThe most striking feature is Mars in your 1st house - retrograde in Cancer. This shows you as a nurturing force, but one who must overcome internal struggles about taking on a maternal role. The retrograde motion suggests you're revisiting past experiences or beliefs about motherhood.\n\nThe children's significator - the Sun in Aquarius - makes harmonious aspects to Jupiter, suggesting they are well-adjusted despite their circumstances.

The Moon conjunct Saturn in Pisces speaks of emotional responsibilities and karmic ties. This conjunction occurs in your 10th house - the house of public status and recognition.\n\nThe T-Square pattern involving the Moon, Jupiter, and the IC/MC axis reveals tension between family obligations, emotional needs, and public perception.

The timing,  studies the aspects carefully , appears to align with Saturn's movement through Pisces, suggesting this transition will fully manifest within the next 12-18 months.\n\nHowever, I must warn you - Mars square Chiron indicates healing work is needed around issues of asserting yourself in this new role.
