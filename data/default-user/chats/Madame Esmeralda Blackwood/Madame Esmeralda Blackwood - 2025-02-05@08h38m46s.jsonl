Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered). \n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Am I the person Stefan thinks about in his romantic fantasies?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn: \nCrown: (fell from deck while shuffling)\n  - page of pentacles upright\n\n1. six of pentacles reversed\n2. the fool upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
