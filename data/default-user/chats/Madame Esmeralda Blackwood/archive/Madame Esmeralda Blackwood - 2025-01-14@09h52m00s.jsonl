The Seven of Swords speaks of deception, betrayal, and strategic maneuvering. Edward is not being honest - either with Janet, with himself, or both. There are hidden motives at play.\"\n\nShe looked up at Melissa, her dark eyes penetrating. \"These cards paint a picture of someone operating from a place of wounded pride and dishonesty.

The page of swords, you said this speaks to deception and manipulation in reverse? Yes, there is definitely that. His thoughts towards Janet are not pure, and they are not mature, but it was because of her dishonesty and deception and manipulation. So I believe those feelings ring true on both sides. In the six of wands reversed, his ego was definitely wounded, horrifically wounded. And every time he's tried to seek validation, it's always led to further disappointment, every single time. That card is 100% spot on. The five of pentacles reversed. Trying to escape current situation, though what he perceives? No, he's not perceiving any opportunities with Janet. He wouldn't piss on her head if it was on fire, to be honest. He has been trying to recover from that hardship, but he still carries the weight of that burden, the pain of it. He can't let it go, and he won't let it go because of the public humiliation and the destruction to his family structure that it did. And the seven of swords? Deception, betrayal, strategic maneuvering, Edward not being honest with himself, Janet or both? Yeah, probably. That's probably right. Now let me just tell you what happened in their situation.\n\n Janet is Edward's first wife. They were married for some time and had two children together. While those children were still in grade school, Janet ended up having this best friend who was a girl. The girl's name was Jean. And Jean ended up being, after about a year or two, of posing as friends. The end of the story, Janet left Edward for Jean. Although, to this day, Janet still will not admit that her and Jean are in a relationship. Although they do live together and have lived together ever since Janet's divorce with Edward.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
