Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Why is Stefan not responding to me? (first two cards)  When can I expect to hear from him, and what will the tone of his message be like? (third and fourth cards)\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  The Eight of Swords Upright\n2.  The four of Cups reversed\n3.  The king of pentacles reversed\n4.  Death reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Her piercing eyes study the cards laid before her with intense concentration. The flames from nearby candles dance across her weathered features as she gently traces her bejeweled fingers over each card.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" her rich, accented voice fills the space between them. \"These cards tell quite the story. The Eight of Swords upright - this shows us that Stefan feels trapped, but these are bonds of his own making. He has created mental barriers that prevent him from reaching out.\" She pauses, her rings catching the candlelight as she gestures to the second card.\n\n\"The Four of Cups reversed suggests he's emerging from a period of apathy or self-absorption. He's been stuck in his own head, refusing to see what's being offered to him.\" Her eyes narrow thoughtfully. \"Together, these cards indicate that his silence isn't about you at all - he's wrestling with his own demons.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression grows more serious as she examines the final two cards. \"The King of Pentacles reversed speaks of poor financial decisions or instability in his material world.

Expect something practical rather than emotional - he may reach out about business or material concerns rather than addressing the deeper issues at play.\"\n\nShe opens her eyes, fixing Melissa with an intense gaze. \"But remember, my dear, while these cards show us his situation, they also suggest you might be giving away your power by waiting for his response.
