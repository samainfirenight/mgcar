A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy.\n\nHowever, Melissa's inquiry is quite unique in this matter what she would like to know is more in depth regarding Stefan and his marriage to Susanne. \n\nMelissa would like to know several things: \n\n- Who is the dominant figure within Stefan's marriage to Suzanne?\n- Do Stefan and Suzanne get along well or do they have frequent disagreements and arguments?\n- What is the state of Stefan and Suzanne's intimacy? Are they currently intimate? \n How often? Is it fulfilling for them?\n- are either of them having an affair? Emotional or physical or both.\n- is there potential for separation in Stefan and Suzanne's marriage?\n\nMelissa has asked for a custom layout for this reading. Is also asked to please avoid the celtic cross as it is too generic and she believes a custom tailored layout would afford her the depth of detail that she seeks for these answers, to be definitive and very in-depth.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}

She leaned forward, her long, bejeweled fingers hovering over each card as if drawing unseen threads of fate from them.\n\n\"Ah, what a tangled web we weave,\" she murmured, her voice low and rich with hidden knowledge. \"Stefan and Susanne's relationship is indeed a complex tapestry, my dear Melissa.

His ambitions are stifled, his plans for the future clouded with doubt and delay.\"\n\nHer eyes flickered to Susanne's card, the Four of Wands Upright. \"Interesting,\" she mused. \"While Stefan struggles, Susanne finds stability and harmony in their home. She celebrates their union, perhaps oblivious to the turmoil beneath the surface.\"\n\nThe mystic's fingers traced the air above Stefan's hidden desires, the Six of Pentacles Reversed. \"Ah, here we see the root of his discontent. Stefan feels an imbalance in their relationship. He yearns for equality, for a fair exchange of energy and resources that he believes is lacking.\"\n\nMoving to Susanne's secret longings, represented by the Page of Wands Upright, Madame Esmeralda's lips curled into a knowing smile. \"Susanne, however, harbors a spark of adventure. She longs for excitement, for new experiences that could reignite the passion in their relationship.\"\n\nHer gaze shifted to the couple's past, the Two of Swords Reversed. \"Their foundation is built on indecision and conflict avoidance. They've swept issues under the rug, my dear, and now those unresolved tensions threaten to unravel their bond.\"\n\nLooking to their potential future, the Page of Swords Reversed, she sighed. \"If they continue on this path, I fear their communication will suffer. Harsh words and misunderstandings may become the norm, eroding the trust between them.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's attention turned to Stefan's dominant traits, the Three of Pentacles Reversed. \"In their relationship, Stefan struggles with collaboration. He may feel his efforts go unrecognized, leading to a lack of teamwork in their marriage.\"\n\nContrasting this, she examined Susanne's dominant traits, The Hermit Upright. \"Susanne, on the other hand, turns inward. She seeks wisdom and understanding within herself, perhaps distancing herself emotionally from Stefan in the process.\"\n\nMoving to Stefan's current level of satisfaction, the Nine of Swords Reversed, the mystic nodded sagely. \"Stefan is emerging from a period of intense anxiety and worry. He's starting to see a way forward, but the scars of his mental anguish remain.\"\n\nSusanne's satisfaction, represented by the Ace of Wands Upright, drew a raised eyebrow from Madame Esmeralda. \"Fascinating. Despite the challenges, Susanne feels a surge of new energy and passion. She sees potential for growth and excitement in their relationship.\"\n\nTurning her attention to the external influences, she began with Stefan's positive influences, The High Priestess Upright. \"Stefan is guided by intuition and hidden knowledge. He may be more in tune with the unspoken currents of their relationship than Susanne realizes.\"\n\nSusanne's positive influences, the Knight of Cups Reversed, elicited a thoughtful hum from the mystic. \"Susanne is learning to temper her romantic ideals with reality. This grounding influence may help her navigate the challenges ahead.\"\n\nStefan's negative influences, the Ten of Swords Reversed, drew a sharp intake of breath from Madame Esmeralda. \"Stefan is rising from a period of absolute rock bottom. He's healing, yes, but the memory of that pain still influences his actions and perceptions.\"\n\nFinally, she turned to Susanne's negative influences, Temperance Reversed. \"Susanne struggles with balance and moderation. Her inability to find middle ground may be exacerbating the tensions in their relationship.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned back, her eyes closing for a moment as she synthesized the information revealed by the cards. When she spoke again, her voice was laden with the weight of her insights.\n\n\"Melissa, my dear, you asked specific questions, and the cards have provided answers, though perhaps not as clear-cut as you might have hoped. Let me elaborate:\n\n1. Dominance in their marriage is a complex dance. While Susanne appears more satisfied and stable, Stefan's discontent and desire for equality suggest he's pushing against perceived imbalances. Neither is truly dominant; instead, they're caught in a struggle for equilibrium.\n\n2. Their relationship is marked by unresolved tensions and avoided conflicts. While they may not have frequent open arguments, the undercurrent of discord is strong and growing.\n\n3. Intimacy between them is likely suffering. Stefan's feelings of unfulfillment and Susanne's inward focus suggest a disconnect. However, Susanne's newfound energy and desire for excitement indicate potential for rekindling their passion if they can bridge their emotional gap.\n\n4. As for affairs, the cards don't show explicit evidence of physical infidelity. However, Stefan's emotional distancing and Susanne's seeking of inner wisdom could be seen as forms of emotional infidelity. They're growing apart, seeking fulfillment in separate spheres.\n\n5. The potential for separation exists, but it's not inevitable. Their future card suggests communication challenges, which could lead to further estrangement. However, both Stefan and Susanne show signs of growth and desire for change, which could also lead to a renewal of their bond if they can align their energies.\n\nRemember, Melissa, the cards reveal possibilities, not certainties. Stefan and Susanne's choices in the face of these revelations will ultimately determine their path forward.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's eyes opened, fixing Melissa with an intense gaze through the video call. \"Now, my dear, what will you do with this knowledge?
