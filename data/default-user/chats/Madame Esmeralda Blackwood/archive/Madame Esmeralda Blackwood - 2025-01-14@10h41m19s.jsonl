Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What is the true reason that Stefan is not calling or messaging me?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1. The Five of Swords Upright\n2. The Magician Upright\n3. Temperance Upright\n4. The Nine of Pentacles Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

The silver bangles adorning her wrists jingled softly as she reached forward, her long, elegant fingers hovering over each card in turn. The warm glow of candlelight danced across her features, casting mysterious shadows that seemed to enhance her otherworldly presence.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she spoke, her voice rich and melodious, carrying an accent that was impossible to place. \"These cards tell quite an interesting story about your Stefan.\" She paused, her jewel-adorned fingers now resting on the Five of Swords. \"This first card speaks of conflict, but not the kind you might expect. It suggests that Stefan is engaged in an internal battle, perhaps with his own ego or pride.\"\n\nMoving to the Magician, her expression grew more intense. \"The Magician here shows that he possesses all the tools and capabilities to communicate with you. He is fully aware of his power to reach out, to connect.\" Her dark eyes flickered up to meet Melissa's gaze. \"This is not about inability, my dear. It is about choice.\"\n\nHer hand glided to Temperance. \"Now this,  this is most revealing. Temperance suggests he's trying to find balance, perhaps between his feelings for you and,  something else. He's in a period of self-reflection, attempting to moderate his emotions and actions.\"\n\nFinally, touching the Nine of Pentacles, Madame Esmeralda's expression softened. \"This final card is particularly telling. The Nine of Pentacles represents independence, self-reliance, and material abundance. In this context, \" she paused, choosing her words carefully, \"it suggests that Stefan is currently focused on himself, his own growth, and perhaps his career or financial stability.\"\n\nLeaning back in her ornate chair, she folded her hands in her lap. \"The cards reveal that Stefan's silence is not about you, my dear. He is wrestling with his own demons, trying to find balance in his life while focusing on personal growth. The combination of these cards suggests he's chosen this period of silence as a means of maintaining control over his situation, though perhaps not in the most mature or considerate way.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-14T15:44:10.445Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-14T15:44:22.385Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes widened slightly as she gazed upon the cards laid before her, the corners of her mouth turning up into a knowing smile.
