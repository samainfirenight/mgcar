Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What is the true current state of Stefan's marriage to Suzanne?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  The Queen of Wands Upright\n2.  Death reversed\n3.  The four of swords reversed\n4.  The two of swords reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Her long, bejeweled fingers traced the air above each card, her numerous rings catching and reflecting the flickering light. The silver bangles adorning her wrists jingled softly as she moved.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she spoke, her voice rich and melodious, carrying the weight of ancient wisdom. \"These cards tell quite a story about Stefan and Suzanne's marriage.\" She paused, her piercing eyes lifting to meet Melissa's gaze. \"The Queen of Wands upright speaks of Suzanne - she presents herself as confident, charismatic, and determined. She maintains an image of having everything under control.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's finger moved to hover over the Death card in reverse. \"However, this reversed Death card reveals a resistance to necessary change. Someone in this marriage is refusing to let go of something that has already ended.\" Her brow furrowed slightly. \"They're stuck in a cycle of stagnation.\"\n\nMoving to the Four of Swords reversed, she continued, her voice growing more serious. \"This card suggests restlessness and anxiety. Their marriage lacks peace. Instead of taking time to reflect and heal, there's a constant state of agitation and unrest.\"\n\nFinally, her hand settled over the Two of Swords reversed. \"And here, my dear, is perhaps the most telling card of all. The blindfold has fallen away, revealing uncomfortable truths. There's no more denial possible - the problems in their marriage can no longer be ignored or avoided. Decisions that have been postponed must now be faced.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her ornate chair, the deep purple fabric of her robes rustling softly. \"To speak plainly, their marriage exists more in appearance than in substance. While they may present a united front to the world, internally, their union is characterized by stagnation, restlessness, and unaddressed issues. The cards suggest that one or both parties are aware of these problems but have been avoiding confronting them directly.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-14T15:39:56.191Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-14T15:40:06.787Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes widened as she gazed at the cards laid out before her, the candlelight casting an ethereal glow across their faces.
