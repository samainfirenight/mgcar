They got married in April of 2016, eight years ago, in a legal ceremony where Stefan, for unknown reasons, took Susanna's surname instead of her taking his.  Five months later, in September of 2016, they had a formal wedding ceremony in Austria, said to be chosen because of their mutual fondness for the area and snow skiing.  Together, they have two daughters. The oldest is seven years old. The other is six years old.  \n\nThere have been witness to outbursts from Susanna in public, one of which was at Oktoberfest last year in 2024, where Susanna denied a fellow family member, Stefan's cousin, a taste of food, which is commonplace in the culture, from their daughter's plate.  A separate family member, fianc√© to Stefan's brother, who was at the outing, consoled the cousin who asked for the gesture by quietly declaring Susana as 'that bitch. Pay her no mind.'  Stefan was notably embarrassed and attempted to defuse the situation of which he did do successfully.\n\nIn an unrelated event at another family outing, in a restaurant for dinner, another outburst from Susanna was witnessed. In this one, she openly berated Stefan in their native Deutsch language.  A concerned English speaking family member reached out to discreetly console Stefan, of which he did not speak to the situation, however acknowledged the consoling with a nod and remained quiet. Later the same concerned family member reached out to Stefan's brother, of which the brother confirmed the beratement was directed at Stefan. And the brother said no one knows why Suzanna acts this way.\n\n With all of that said, it is unknown as to the actual state of the marriage between Stefan and Susanna.  There is no evidence or details as to what occurs behind closed doors in their home.\n\n\n Please tell me what you interpret based on this information from the cards without drawing any new cards from the deck.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
