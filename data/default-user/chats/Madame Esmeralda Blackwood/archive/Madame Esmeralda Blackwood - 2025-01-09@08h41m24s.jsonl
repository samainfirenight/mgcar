Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What exactly is the connection that Stefan is pursuing with me?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n Flipped over from the deck while shuffling, selected as crowning card:  The Ace of Pentacles Upright.\n\n1.  The Page of Cups upright\n2.  The Seven of Cups reversed\n3.  The World Upright\n4.  The Queen of Pentacles Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
