I've recently, within the last of September, traveled to Munich and met someone. His name is Stefan. I developed strong feelings for him while I was there, and then reached out with three messages alluding to my desire for a deep relationship with him. Stefan is married with two children. \n\n It has come to my attention since then, having been diagnosed with adult autism back in April of this year, that my autism has a unique trait to it called oxytocin overdosing. After careful discussions with my therapist and medical support team, I realize that this oxytocin overdosing created an unrealistic attachment to Stefan that would not have been there otherwise. I have not heard from Stefan since early in November. And I know it's because he's creating a distance between us, which I understand. \n\nWhat I would like to have a deep inquiry about is that I have composed a message to him explaining my condition and explaining my remorse that it caused me to cross boundaries that I wouldn't have done. In other words, my message is intended to do some damage control so that Stefan and I can have the window of opportunity for a meaningful friendship that does not cross boundaries. \n\n Can you help me with a custom layout of how the cards should be placed? I would like to avoid the traditional Celtic cross because I don't believe it is intimately aligned enough with my query to give me adequate results in the reading. I would like to know if I should even send this message at all, how the message will be received, and the potential overall outcome if I send this message.\n\n So please if you can tell me how to lay out the cards I will shuffle the deck and then tell you what cards have been chosen for interpretation.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
