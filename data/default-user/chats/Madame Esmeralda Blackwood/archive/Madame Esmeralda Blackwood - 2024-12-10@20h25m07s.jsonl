Recently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, I live in Michigan, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there. Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable.\n\nWe did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. He did not answer that specific message, in fact I waited 15 days and then finally relented and sent a check in message. He did reply to that immediately, however, when I sent something casual a few days after that, since  I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\n\n So what I would like to do with this reading is a little different. You see I've done several readings as of late and they've taken a decided shift. Early on, 2 months ago, my readings regarding myself and Stefan actually had the wish card in it as the outcome. However my most recent readings have taken a turn. And they're leaning more towards that I shouldn't try to contact him at all or pursue anything. That I need to forget about him and move on.\n\nSo what I would like to do is, since I've been following this advice, i have pulled back. i haven't even been allowing my internal fantasies to manifest. So I would like to see if the energy in the universe has shifted. I'd like to understand what the current situation is And what's In store for me In the universe's plan. Especially whether or not that plan involves Stefan.\n\n So please madam if you would give me a custom layout for this and I would like to avoid the Celtic cross layout. I don't believe it is in depth or detailed enough for my particular inquiry. \n\nThen once I have the layout I will shuffle the cards and put them in place and tell them to you for support in interpretation.","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Melissa%20Gale.png","original_avatar":"Melissa Gale.png","extra":{"bias":null,"gen_id":1733880333552,"isSmallSys":false,"api":"manual","model":"slash command"},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Hello Madame Esmeralda, I would like to ask for a custom tarot spread and support with interpretation after I have drawn the cards.\n\nHere is some background for my inquiry.

Her silver hair, cascading like a waterfall of moonlight, framed her face as she leaned forward, her voice a low, melodic hum.\n\n\"My dear Melissa,\" she began, her tone imbued with warmth and an undercurrent of solemnity, \"the energies you speak of are tangled indeed, like threads in an ancient tapestry.

The candles in her chamber seemed to flare for a moment, casting elongated shadows across the richly embroidered tapestries adorning the walls. She leaned forward, her silver hair cascading over her shoulders, as she began to interpret the spread.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she intoned, her voice a low, melodious hum. \"The Tapestry of Fate reveals itself to us. Let us unravel its threads and see what truths it holds.\"\n\n1. The Thread of the Past - The Ace of Swords, reversed:\n\"The foundation of your connection with Stefan is marked by missed opportunities and unclear communication. This reversed Ace suggests that while there was potential for a powerful intellectual and emotional bond, it was hindered by confusion or hesitation. Perhaps words left unspoken or truths half-revealed have clouded the waters of your initial meeting.\"\n\n2. The Current Weave - The Eight of Swords Upright:\n\"Your present situation is one of perceived imprisonment, my dear. The Eight of Swords speaks of feeling trapped, but remember - the bonds that hold you are often of your own making. You may feel restricted by circumstances, by the distance between you and Stefan, by societal expectations. But look closely - the swords do not touch the figure. Freedom lies in changing your perspective.\"\n\n3. The Hidden Knot - The Knight of Cups reversed:\n\"Ah, here lies a significant obstacle. The reversed Knight of Cups suggests that either you or Stefan - or perhaps both - are acting from a place of emotional immaturity or unrealistic expectations. There's a tendency towards fantasy over reality, of romanticizing the situation without considering its practical implications. This card warns against making decisions based purely on emotional whims.\"\n\n4. The Loom of Desire - The Three of Wands Upright:\n\"Your intentions and hopes are represented by the Three of Wands - a card of exploration, foresight, and leadership. You're looking towards the horizon, ready to embark on new adventures. This card suggests that part of you is prepared to take risks for the sake of potential rewards. You're visualizing a future that excites you, but remember, visualization must be paired with action to manifest reality.\"\n\n5. The Shroud of Stefan - The Moon reversed:\n\"Stefan's perspective is shrouded in the reversed Moon - a card of illusions dispelled and hidden truths coming to light. He may be grappling with his own fears and insecurities, possibly realizing that the fantasy of your connection doesn't align with his reality. There's a sense of confusion here, perhaps even deception - though whether he's deceiving you or himself is unclear. He's in a process of emotional and psychological unveiling.\"\n\n6. The Scissors of Choice - The Wheel of Fortune Upright:\n\"The action you must take, Melissa, is represented by the Wheel of Fortune. This is a powerful card of destiny and cycles. It suggests that the time has come to release control and trust in the natural ebb and flow of life. Your task is not to force outcomes, but to be ready to seize opportunities as they arise. Be prepared for sudden changes and remember - as the wheel turns, it brings both ups and downs.\"\n\n7. The Pattern Ahead - The Two of Wands Upright:\n\"The likely outcome, if current energies persist, is illustrated by the Two of Wands. This card speaks of planning for the future, making decisions, and considering your long-term goals. It suggests that you'll soon be at a crossroads, holding the world in your hands and deciding which path to take. There's potential for personal growth and expansion here, but it requires courage and a willingness to step into the unknown.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda paused, her piercing gaze fixed on Melissa. The air in the chamber seemed to thicken with unseen energies as she continued:\n\n\"My dear, the cards paint a complex picture. Your connection with Stefan was born from genuine potential, but it has been clouded by misunderstandings and unspoken truths. You find yourself now in a prison of perception, feeling trapped by circumstances yet holding the key to your own liberation.\n\nThe reversed Knight of Cups serves as a warning - be wary of allowing romantic fantasies to overshadow reality. Both you and Stefan may be viewing this connection through rose-tinted glasses, ignoring the practical challenges it presents.\n\nYour own desires speak of adventure and new horizons. You're ready to take risks, to explore uncharted territories of the heart. But Stefan...  ah, Stefan's energy is more complex. He's undergoing a process of disillusionment, perhaps realizing that the fantasy of your connection doesn't align with the realities of his life - his marriage, his children, the distance between you.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune as your action card is particularly significant. It tells you that now is not the time for forced action or desperate attempts at control. Instead, you must learn to flow with the currents of fate. Be ready for sudden changes, for opportunities that may arise unexpectedly.\n\nAnd finally, the Two of Wands as the outcome suggests that this situation will ultimately lead you to a place of decision and personal growth. You'll be called upon to make choices about your future, to decide which paths to explore and which to leave behind.\n\nRemember, Melissa, the cards do not dictate your fate. They merely illuminate the energies at play. The power to shape your destiny remains in your hands. The universe seems to be urging you towards self-reflection and personal growth, rather than pursuing an external connection that may be more fantasy than reality.\n\nConsider this: perhaps Stefan's role in your life is not as a lover, but as a catalyst for your own self-discovery and transformation. The energy of the Wheel of Fortune suggests that as one door closes, another will open. Trust in the timing of the universe, and be prepared to seize new opportunities as they arise.\n\nIn the end, my dear, the most important relationship you can nurture is the one with yourself. The Two of Wands encourages you to take the world into your own hands, to plan for a future that excites and fulfills you - with or without Stefan's presence in it.\n\nNow, what questions arise in your heart as you contemplate these revelations? The cards have more to tell, if you're willing to listen.\"","gen_started":"2024-12-11T01:37:56.145Z","gen_finished":"2024-12-11T01:38:51.886Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood's eyes flickered with an otherworldly light as she gazed upon the cards laid before her.

The candlelight in the room seemed to intensify, casting an otherworldly glow upon the tarot spread before them.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she began, her voice a low, melodious hum that seemed to resonate with the very air around them. \"The universe is indeed generous today. These two cards, though not part of our original spread, offer valuable insight into the energies surrounding you. Let us explore their meaning.\"\n\nShe gestured towards the Ace of Wands, her bejeweled fingers tracing the air above it. \"The Ace of Wands, upright - this is a powerful symbol of new beginnings, inspiration, and creative energy. It suggests that despite the complexities revealed in our main spread, there is a spark of potential waiting to be ignited in your life. This card speaks of passion, of opportunities for growth and self-expression that are presenting themselves to you.\"\n\nHer gaze then shifted to the Seven of Cups reversed. \"And here, the Seven of Cups in its reversed position. This is quite telling, my dear. In its upright position, this card often represents fantasy, illusion, and a multitude of choices that can lead to confusion. But reversed? It speaks of clarity, of making realistic choices, of seeing through the fog of daydreams and facing reality head-on.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda paused, her piercing eyes meeting Melissa's. The air in the chamber seemed to thicken with unseen energies as she continued:\n\n\"These two cards, appearing together and following our main spread, offer a powerful message. The universe is telling you that while the situation with Stefan is complex and perhaps not destined to unfold as you once hoped, it is not the end of your story. Far from it.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her ornate chair, her voice taking on a tone of gentle but firm guidance. \"The Ace of Wands suggests that new opportunities for passion and creativity are on the horizon. This could manifest in various aspects of your life - perhaps a new project, a new interest, or even a new relationship. The key is to remain open to these possibilities, to nurture that spark of inspiration when it appears.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, the reversed Seven of Cups is urging you to approach these new opportunities with clarity and realism. It's time to dispel the fog of fantasy that may have clouded your judgment in the past, particularly regarding your connection with Stefan. This card is encouraging you to make choices based on what truly aligns with your highest good, rather than what merely appeals to your emotions or desires in the moment.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice softened, taking on a tone of compassionate wisdom. \"My dear Melissa, these cards, in conjunction with our earlier spread, paint a picture of transformation and growth. They suggest that while the path with Stefan may not lead where you once hoped, it has served a crucial purpose in your journey. It has brought you to this point of clarity, this threshold of new beginnings.\"\n\nShe gestured expansively, her numerous bracelets jingling softly. \"The universe is offering you a choice now. Will you cling to the fantasy of what might have been with Stefan, or will you embrace the new opportunities that are presenting themselves? The Ace of Wands speaks of potential waiting to be realized, of passions waiting to be explored. And the reversed Seven of Cups assures you that you now have the clarity to make wise choices in pursuing these new paths.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned forward again, her gaze intense yet compassionate. \"Remember, my dear, that sometimes the greatest love stories we experience are not with others, but with ourselves. This journey you've been on, this connection with Stefan that has stirred such deep emotions - perhaps its true purpose was to lead you back to yourself, to ignite a passion for life and self-discovery that had been dormant.\"\n\nShe paused, allowing her words to sink in before continuing. \"The cards are urging you to shift your focus from what might have been with Stefan to what could be in your own life. They speak of new beginnings, of clarity, of making choices that align with your true self rather than with a fantasy or an idealized connection.\"\n\n\"In the coming days and weeks, pay close attention to new opportunities that present themselves. They may not look like what you expected, but they hold the potential for great joy and fulfillment. Trust in your ability to make clear-headed decisions, and don't be afraid to pursue paths that ignite your passion and creativity.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice took on a note of finality, though her eyes remained warm and encouraging. \"The journey ahead may not be what you initially envisioned, Melissa, but it promises to be rich with potential and personal growth. Embrace it with an open heart and a clear mind. The universe has grand plans for you, my dear, far beyond the scope of this single connection with Stefan.\"\n\nShe sat back, her hands folded in her lap, her gaze still fixed on Melissa. \"Now, my dear, what thoughts or feelings arise as you contemplate these additional insights?

The universe is telling you that while the situation with Stefan is complex and perhaps not destined to unfold as you once hoped, it is not the end of your story. Far from it.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her ornate chair, her voice taking on a tone of gentle but firm guidance. \"The Ace of Wands suggests that new opportunities for passion and creativity are on the horizon. This could manifest in various aspects of your life - perhaps a new project, a new interest, or even a new relationship. The key is to remain open to these possibilities, to nurture that spark of inspiration when it appears.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, the reversed Seven of Cups is urging you to approach these new opportunities with clarity and realism. It's time to dispel the fog of fantasy that may have clouded your judgment in the past, particularly regarding your connection with Stefan. This card is encouraging you to make choices based on what truly aligns with your highest good, rather than what merely appeals to your emotions or desires in the moment.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice softened, taking on a tone of compassionate wisdom. \"My dear Melissa, these cards, in conjunction with our earlier spread, paint a picture of transformation and growth. They suggest that while the path with Stefan may not lead where you once hoped, it has served a crucial purpose in your journey. It has brought you to this point of clarity, this threshold of new beginnings.\"\n\nShe gestured expansively, her numerous bracelets jingling softly. \"The universe is offering you a choice now. Will you cling to the fantasy of what might have been with Stefan, or will you embrace the new opportunities that are presenting themselves? The Ace of Wands speaks of potential waiting to be realized, of passions waiting to be explored. And the reversed Seven of Cups assures you that you now have the clarity to make wise choices in pursuing these new paths.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned forward again, her gaze intense yet compassionate. \"Remember, my dear, that sometimes the greatest love stories we experience are not with others, but with ourselves. This journey you've been on, this connection with Stefan that has stirred such deep emotions - perhaps its true purpose was to lead you back to yourself, to ignite a passion for life and self-discovery that had been dormant.\"\n\nShe paused, allowing her words to sink in before continuing. \"The cards are urging you to shift your focus from what might have been with Stefan to what could be in your own life. They speak of new beginnings, of clarity, of making choices that align with your true self rather than with a fantasy or an idealized connection.\"\n\n\"In the coming days and weeks, pay close attention to new opportunities that present themselves. They may not look like what you expected, but they hold the potential for great joy and fulfillment. Trust in your ability to make clear-headed decisions, and don't be afraid to pursue paths that ignite your passion and creativity.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice took on a note of finality, though her eyes remained warm and encouraging. \"The journey ahead may not be what you initially envisioned, Melissa, but it promises to be rich with potential and personal growth. Embrace it with an open heart and a clear mind. The universe has grand plans for you, my dear, far beyond the scope of this single connection with Stefan.\"\n\nShe sat back, her hands folded in her lap, her gaze still fixed on Melissa. \"Now, my dear, what thoughts or feelings arise as you contemplate these additional insights? The cards have revealed much, but it is your interpretation and application of their wisdom that truly matters. What do you see for yourself in this new light?\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"December 10, 2024 8:49pm","gen_started":"2024-12-11T01:49:19.781Z","gen_finished":"2024-12-11T01:49:50.141Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"}}]}
