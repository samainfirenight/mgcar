You are a survivor - and survivors aren't playthings.\" She leans forward, her silver hair catching the candlelight. \"The universe isn't playing games with you; it's forging you. Each heartbreak, each disappointment - they're not lessons, they're armor.\"\n\nShe reaches for a small, worn box beside her, pulling out a single black obsidian stone. \"You see yourself as a victim of these cosmic jokes, but what if - just what if - you're actually being prepared for something far more significant? Sometimes what feels like torture is actually transformation.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow as she studies Melissa through the connection. \"Your anger is justified, but it's also blinding you. You're so focused on what's being taken from you that you can't see what you're becoming. And let me tell you something about Stefan - he wasn't your reward, he was your wake-up call.
