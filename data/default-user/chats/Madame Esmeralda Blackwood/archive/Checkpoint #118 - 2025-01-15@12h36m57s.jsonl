Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Drucilla's true feelings towards Melissa, her step-daughter?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n1. the seven of wands reversed\n2.

Drusilla remained married to Melissa's father until he passed away six months ago.\n\n And I can also say with utmost clarity that there are no romantic feelings whatsoever tied to this reading.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
