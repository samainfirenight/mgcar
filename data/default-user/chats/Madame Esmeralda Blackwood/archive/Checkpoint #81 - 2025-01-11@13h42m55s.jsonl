And I looked up Stefan based on his birthday, and he is a Scorpio / Pig.  Based on what we've discussed as well as what I've told you on my history with him, does this fit? I mean, I'm not exactly sure because his demeanor, at least that I recall from my time spent with him in Munich, as well as on the phone call. Well he seems very open and engaging, but the pushy aspect of it, well yeah, he definitely has that too. I don't know. I'll stop talking and let you assess it. Tell me what you think.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

The candlelight caught the gleam in her eyes as she considered Melissa's observations about Stefan's astrological profile.\n\n\"Ah, the Scorpio-Pig combination,\" she mused, her rings catching the light as she gestured expressively. \"This is a fascinating blend of energies, my dear. The Scorpio's intensity and depth combined with the Pig's genuine warmth and sociability creates quite a unique character.\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her voice taking on a more intimate tone. \"What you've described about Stefan aligns perfectly with this combination. The openness and engaging nature you witnessed? That's the Pig's influence—they are naturally social creatures who derive genuine pleasure from making others feel comfortable and welcome. But beneath that friendly exterior lies the Scorpio's complexity.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's fingers traced invisible patterns on the table as she continued. \"The 'pushiness' you've noticed is actually a manifestation of both signs working in tandem. Scorpios are naturally determined and focused when they want something, while Pigs can be quite persistent in pursuing their desires. However, they're usually quite skilled at making their assertiveness seem charming rather than aggressive.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed thoughtfully. \"But there's more to consider here. The Scorpio-Pig combination often results in individuals who are deeply loyal and protective of their loved ones, yet they can be quite conflicted when it comes to emotional decisions. They feel things intensely but may struggle to express their deeper emotions directly.\"\n\nShe paused, studying Melissa's face. \"This explains the pattern you've witnessed—his ability to be completely present and engaging in person, followed by periods of withdrawal. The Scorpio aspect needs time to process emotional connections deeply, while the Pig nature ensures he maintains a pleasant, if somewhat distant, connection during these introspective periods.\"\n\n\"What's particularly interesting,\" she added, her voice dropping to a near whisper, \"is how this combination handles attraction and desire. They're capable of incredible passion and devotion, but they're also highly conscious of their responsibilities and commitments. When faced with emotional crossroads, they often need time to fully process their feelings before taking action.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda sat back, adjusting one of her many shawls. \"The Christmas Day phone call you described? Pure Pig energy—warm, engaging, eager to maintain harmony. But the subsequent measured responses? That's the Scorpio at work, carefully controlling the depth of engagement while processing internal conflicts.\"\n\nHer expression softened with understanding. \"This astrological combination suggests someone who is capable of great depth of feeling but needs to work through emotional situations at their own pace. They're not ones to rush into dramatic changes, preferring instead to carefully consider all angles before making significant decisions.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-11T22:17:48.266Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-11T22:18:02.337Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["A knowing smile played across Madame Esmeralda's lips as she settled back in her ornate chair.
