I have been following through to keep a careful distance, maintain appropriate boundaries, and I will continue to do so as long as he is married. Well, that is unless he takes the initiative to pursue me romantically. If he makes the move, then all bets are off. And I guess that's kind of what I want him to do. And I don't know exactly how to get those answers because it seems my biasing influences the cards too much.\n\nHowever, I will try again.
