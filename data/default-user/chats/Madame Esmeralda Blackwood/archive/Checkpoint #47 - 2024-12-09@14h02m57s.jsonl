Recently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, I live in Michigan, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there. Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable.\n\nWe did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. He did not answer that specific message, in fact I waited 15 days and then finally relented and sent a check in message. He did reply to that immediately, however, when I sent something casual a few days after that, since  I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\n\n So what I would like to do with this reading is a little different. You see I've done several readings as of late and they've taken a decided shift. Early on, 2 months ago, my readings regarding myself and Stefan actually had the wish card in it as the outcome. However my most recent readings have taken a turn. And they're leaning more towards that I shouldn't try to contact him at all or pursue anything. That I need to forget about him and move on.\n\nSo what I would like to do is, since I've been following this advice, i have pulled back. i haven't even been allowing my internal fantasies to manifest. So I would like to see if the energy in the universe has shifted. I'd like to understand what the current situation is And what's In store for me In the universe's plan. Especially whether or not that plan involves Stefan.\n\n So please madam if you would give me a custom layout for this and I would like to avoid the Celtic cross layout. I don't believe it is in depth or detailed enough for my particular inquiry. \n\nThen once I have the layout I will shuffle the cards and put them in place and tell them to you for support in interpretation.

The air in her chamber was thick with the scent of sandalwood and aged parchment, the flickering candlelight casting shadows that danced across the intricate designs of her tarot deck, laid reverently before her. Her silver hair, cascading like a waterfall of moonlight, framed her face as she leaned forward, her voice a low, melodic hum.\n\n\"My dear Melissa,\" she began, her tone imbued with warmth and an undercurrent of solemnity, \"the energies you speak of are tangled indeed, like threads in an ancient tapestry. To unravel them, we must create a spread as unique as your situation—a spread that reflects not only the past and present but the deeper currents shaping your path and the unseen forces at play.\"\n\nShe reached for her deck, the cards seemingly alive in her hands as she shuffled them with practiced precision. \"For this reading, we shall employ a custom layout—The Tapestry of Fate. It will consist of seven positions, each representing a vital aspect of your journey and the energies surrounding Stefan.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda paused, allowing the weight of her words to settle. She began to outline the spread with deliberate care:\n\n1. **The Thread of the Past** – This card will reveal the foundation of your connection with Stefan and the energies that brought you together.\n2. **The Current Weave** – This card represents the present state of your relationship and the influences affecting it.\n3. **The Hidden Knot** – This card uncovers any unseen obstacles or forces at work, whether internal or external.\n4. **The Loom of Desire** – This card reflects your own intentions, emotions, and hopes regarding Stefan and the situation.\n5. **The Shroud of Stefan** – This card offers insight into Stefan's perspective, feelings, and intentions, as they stand now.\n6. **The Scissors of Choice** – This card illuminates the decision or action you must take to align with the universe's plan.\n7. **The Pattern Ahead** – This card reveals the likely outcome or direction if the current energies remain unchanged.\n\nMadame Esmeralda gestured to the deck before her. \"Now, Melissa, take a moment to center yourself. Focus on your breath and let your thoughts settle like leaves on a still pond. When you are ready, shuffle your own deck with these positions in mind, allowing the cards to absorb your energy and intent. Once you have drawn and placed them in order, tell me their identities, and I shall guide you through their interpretation.\"\n\nHer voice softened, yet carried a sense of urgency. \"Remember, the cards are but mirrors to the soul and whispers of the universe. They do not dictate your fate but offer you clarity and guidance. Let us see what truths they hold for you today.\"","gen_started":"2024-12-09T19:00:30.181Z","gen_finished":"2024-12-09T19:00:40.810Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood regarded the inquiry with a contemplative expression, her deep-set eyes glimmering with an otherworldly light.

Her bejeweled fingers traced the air above each card, and the candles flickered in response to the potent energies being revealed.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she breathed, her voice carrying both wisdom and concern. \"These cards tell quite a story. Let us examine them carefully.\"\n\nShe gestured to the Five of Cups in the first position. \"The Thread of the Past shows loss and regret, but notice—two cups remain standing behind the figure. This suggests that while there was indeed a powerful connection between you and Stefan, it was born from a place of mutual emotional vulnerability. Perhaps you both were seeking something missing in your lives.\"\n\nMoving to the Four of Swords, she nodded thoughtfully. \"The Current Weave speaks of forced rest, a period of contemplation. The universe is demanding that you take this time to reflect and recover. This aligns perfectly with your decision to pull back.\"\n\nHer expression grew more serious as she regarded the reversed Sun. \"The Hidden Knot reveals temporary shadows obscuring joy. There are obstacles you cannot see—likely involving Stefan's family obligations and perhaps even his own internal struggles with loyalty versus desire.\"\n\nTouching the reversed Three of Cups, her voice lowered. \"The Loom of Desire shows your emotions are turned inward. You're experiencing a sense of isolation from joy and celebration. Your heart yearns for connection, but you're holding yourself back, afraid to fully embrace these feelings.\"\n\nA slight smile crossed her face at the Queen of Cups. \"The Shroud of Stefan reveals something quite interesting. He sees you as this Queen—intuitive, emotionally deep, nurturing. This card suggests he holds you in high regard, perhaps even idealizes you. However, being in this position, it may also indicate he's more captivated by the idea of you than ready to face the reality of what pursuing a relationship would mean.\"\n\nHer rings caught the candlelight as she pointed to the Ace of Cups. \"The Scissors of Choice presents new emotional beginnings, but not necessarily with Stefan. The universe is suggesting that you open yourself to new emotional experiences rather than clinging to this particular connection.\"\n\nFinally, her eyes rested on the Star. \"The Pattern Ahead brings hope and renewal, my dear. But notice—this card comes after the suggestion of new beginnings. The universe is showing you that your greatest hope lies not in pursuing Stefan, but in healing and opening yourself to new possibilities.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned back, her silver hair catching the candlelight. \"The overall message is clear: while the connection with Stefan was real and meaningful, it served its purpose in your spiritual journey. It was meant to awaken you to new possibilities, to show you that you could feel deeply again. But it was not meant to be your final destination.\"\n\nShe reached across the table, her warm hand hovering near Melissa's. \"The cards suggest that pursuing Stefan would lead to further disappointment.
