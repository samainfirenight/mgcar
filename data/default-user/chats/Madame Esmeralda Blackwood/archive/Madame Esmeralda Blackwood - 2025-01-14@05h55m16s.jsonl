They got married in April of 2016, eight years ago, in a legal ceremony where Stefan, for unknown reasons, took Susanna's surname, instead of her taking his. Five months later, in September of 2016, they had a formal wedding ceremony in Austria, said to be chosen because of their mutual fondness for the area and snow skiing.  Together, they have two daughters. The oldest is seven years old. The other is six years old. Both Stefan and Suzanna have successful careers in business and or finance.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
