Although we did not have any intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable. \n\n I would like to do the below reading spread. I'll shuffle the deck and start drawing the cards one by one. Will you help me with the interpretation? \nLayout of the Cards:\n\n1. Current Energies: This card reveals the present dynamics surrounding Stefan and his marriage to Suzanna.\n\n2.
