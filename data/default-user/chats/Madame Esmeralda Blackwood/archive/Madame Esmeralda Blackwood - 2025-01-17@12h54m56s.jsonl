Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Is Stefan truly just a nice guy - that doesn't understand his actions can be interpreted as having romantic feelings?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n1. The Ace of Swords Upright\n2. The Six of Swords Upright\n3. The Seven of Cups Reversed\n4. The King of Swords reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}

Her weathered hands, adorned with numerous rings, move gracefully as she adjusts her position, ensuring better visibility of the spread. The soft clink of her bangles accompanies her movements as she leans forward, her silver hair catching the dim light of the numerous candles surrounding her.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Isa,\" she speaks, her voice rich with wisdom and a hint of concern. \"These cards tell quite an interesting story about Stefan.\" She pauses, touching her temple with a bejeweled finger. \"The Ace of Swords upright speaks of clarity and truth - but not the truth you might be hoping for. This man knows exactly what he's doing.\"\n\nHer piercing gaze intensifies as she studies the Six of Swords. \"He's very deliberately moving away from something - or someone - in his past. This transition is calculated, not innocent.\" She traces the air above where the card would be if she were present. \"The Seven of Cups reversed paired with this tells me he's done playing games. He's focused now, and his intentions are quite,  specific.\"\n\nA knowing smile crosses her lips as she examines the final card. \"And here, the King of Swords reversed - this is most telling. No, my dear, Stefan is not 'just a nice guy.' He is manipulative, perhaps even deliberately using confusion as a tool. He presents himself as naive about his actions, but this card reveals his true nature - he's being intentionally deceptive about his intentions.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda sits back in her ornate chair, her expression grave. \"He knows exactly how his actions appear to others.
