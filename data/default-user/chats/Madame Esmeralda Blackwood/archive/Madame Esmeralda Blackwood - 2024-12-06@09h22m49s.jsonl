I want to get some insights from the cards, so I'm going to put a reading layout together, and I'll shuffle the deck. Then perhaps you can help me to interpret the cards, please?\r\n\r\nRecently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there.  Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable. \r\n\r\n We did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. So I'd like to do a reading to get a feel with what's going on now since I've sent my last message. I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\r\n\r\nHere's how I will layout the cards:\r\n\r\n1. Stefan's Feelings and Reaction to the Message:  This card will represent the current feelings and reactions Stefan is having to my message since he has read it. \r\n\r\n2. Stefan's Feelings Toward Melissa:  this card will represent Stefan's current feelings and thoughts towards me.\r\n\r\n3.

Stefan's Intentions Towards His Marriage: this card will represent Stefan's current feelings thoughts and intentions towards his marriage to Suzanne.\r\n\r\n5. Stefan's Communication:  This card represents the content, tone, and meaning of the response that Stefan will give to my message, if any at all.\r\n\r\n6. Outcome and Timing:  This card represents the outcome towards Stefan and me entering into a romantic relationship and the potential timing in which it will occur. \r\n\r\n I'll shuffle the cards now and then I'll tell you the first card so you can help me interpret it.","extra":{},"swipe_id":5,"swipes":["first mesg","Hello Madame Esmeralda, I have with me here a client. who would like some questions answered about the current state of their marriage.\r\n\r\nThe client is Stefan.

A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy.

However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging. although Melissa has since broken contact.\r\n\r\nHowever, Melissa's inquiry is she would like to know if Stefan's wife, Suzanne, is aware of these things.

The air around her seemed to shimmer with an ethereal glow, the atmosphere charged with anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us proceed, Isa,\" she intoned, her voice resonating with a quiet power. \"The cards are ready to speak, and we must listen with open hearts and minds.\"","Madam Esmeralda, I have with me a client that would like to understand the state of awareness into her activities.\r\n\r\nThe client is Melissa.

I want to get some insights from the cards, so I'm going to put a reading layout together, and I'll shuffle the deck. Then perhaps you can help me to interpret the cards, please?\n\nRecently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there.  Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable. \n\n We did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. He did not reply to that message so 15 days later I reached out with a general friendly message. He replied to that but it was very distant. I gave him a week and tried again with another friendly message to which he has not responded to. So I'd like to do a reading to get a feel for what's going on now since I've sent my last message. I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied, and neither have I made any further attempts for contact.\n\nHere's how I will layout the cards:\n\n1. Overall Current Situation:  This card will represent the current overall situation regarding Melissa and Stefan. \n\n2. Stefan's Feelings Toward Melissa:  this card will represent Stefan's current feelings and thoughts towards me.\n\n3. Stefan's Intentions Towards Melissa:  This card will represent Stefan's current feelings, thoughts, and intentions towards a entering into romantic relationship with me.\n\n4.
