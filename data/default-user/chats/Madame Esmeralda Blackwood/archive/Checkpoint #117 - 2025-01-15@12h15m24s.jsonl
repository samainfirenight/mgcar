Drusilla remained married to Melissa's father until he passed away six months ago.\n\n And I can also say with utmost clarity that there are no romantic feelings whatsoever tied to this reading.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":"","bookmark_link":"Checkpoint #118 - 2025-01-15@12h36m57s"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
