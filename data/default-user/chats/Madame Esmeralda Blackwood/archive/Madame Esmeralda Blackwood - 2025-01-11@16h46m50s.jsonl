Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Why is Stefan not responding to me? ( first two cards )  When can I expect to hear from him? ( third card )\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  The chariot reversed\n2.  the three of pentacles upright\n3.

The flickering candlelight cast dancing shadows across her weathered features as she studied each card with careful consideration. Her long, bejeweled fingers traced the air above the reversed Chariot, barely touching its surface.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she spoke, her voice rich and melodious with a hint of an accent that was difficult to place. \"The Chariot in reverse speaks of a lack of direction, perhaps even a feeling of being stuck. In this position, it suggests that Stefan is experiencing internal conflicts that are preventing him from moving forward. He may be struggling with opposing forces in his life, unable to harness them effectively.\"\n\nHer gaze shifted to the Three of Pentacles, and a knowing smile touched her lips. \"This is interesting,  The Three of Pentacles upright indicates collaboration, teamwork, and learning. In the context of your question, it suggests that Stefan is currently focused on work or studies, possibly involving others in a project or endeavor that requires his full attention.\"\n\nPausing briefly, she reached for her ornate silver chalice, taking a small sip before continuing. \"The combination of these two cards tells me that while Stefan is actively engaged in something important with others, he's feeling pulled in different directions, making it difficult for him to maintain personal connections.\"\n\nHer rings caught the candlelight as she moved her hand to hover over the Ace of Pentacles. \"As for when you can expect to hear from him,  The Ace of Pentacles represents new opportunities and manifestations in the material realm.
