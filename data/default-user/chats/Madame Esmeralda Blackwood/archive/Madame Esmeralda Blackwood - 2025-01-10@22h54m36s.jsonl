Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: After such a notable shift in Stefan's demeanor towards me, why is he now not responding again?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  The five of Cups reversed\n2.  The King of Pentacles Upright\n3.  The Empress Upright\n4.  The Queen of Cups Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

Her bejeweled fingers traced the air above each card, feeling their energy. The silver bangles on her wrists chimed softly with each movement.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she spoke, her voice rich and melodious, carrying the weight of ancient wisdom. \"These cards tell quite an interesting story about your situation with Stefan.\" She adjusted her deep purple shawl, adorned with silver threads that caught the light.\n\n\"The Five of Cups reversed speaks of recovery from disappointment and moving forward. In this position, it suggests that Stefan has been dealing with his own emotional healing. He's learning to see the cups that remain standing rather than focusing on what has been spilled.\"\n\nHer rings caught the candlelight as she moved her hand to the next card. \"The King of Pentacles upright - this is fascinating. This represents someone who is focused on material success, security, and building something stable. He's currently immersed in practical matters, perhaps work or financial concerns.\"\n\nShe paused, her dark eyes flickering with understanding as they moved to the third card. \"The Empress,  she represents abundance, nurturing, and fertility. In this context, she suggests that you embody these qualities for Stefan. You represent something nurturing and abundant in his life.\"\n\nFinally, her hand hovered over the Queen of Cups. \"And here we have the Queen of Cups upright - she represents emotional intelligence, intuition, and compassion. This is your energy, my dear. You're approaching this situation with genuine emotional depth and understanding.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned back in her ornate chair, the beads in her silver hair clicking softly. \"The message here is quite clear.

Your intuitive, compassionate approach is exactly what's needed, but patience is required.
