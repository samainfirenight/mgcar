And it doesn't necessarily have to be something that I'm passionately attached to. It can even be a question that I'm not necessarily passionately attached to. But then when I validate the answer, go back and look at my transcripts that I've taken from my journal after I do a session, most of the time it's wrong. The answer will be wrong. I may have gotten a yes from my pendulum that was a definitive, very strong yes, in fact, because when my pendulum gives me a weak yes, it takes me a little while to understand that that's what it's doing. But when it gives a strong yes, it's definitely a swing. And when it gives a strong no, there's no mistaking it. But most of the time it's wrong. I can give some examples if you would like, but I don't understand. \n\n Actually, for instance, here's one that's a pretty easy one to recall for you. A good friend of mine from work, his wife was pregnant at the time, and they were about a week away from going to have the ultrasound to sex their baby. And out of curiosity, he asked me if I would use my pendulum, and I did. And the pendulum directed, based on my question, I said, is Tom and his wife's baby going to be a girl? The pendulum gave a very strong no. When they sexed the baby the following week, it was a girl. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

Because that is absolutely not going to work for me. Considering my neurodivergence, my mind mixed with the ISTP personality, I have never been able to successfully meditate. I cannot be hypnotized. There's just many things that come with that, that it just doesn't work for me, and it probably never will. I don't see that as a limitation. I've found other ways to work around it. I feel like my relationship with my tarot deck is very sound and very good in my I Ching. But things that require that deep meditative state, yeah, that's definitely not a working thing for me.
