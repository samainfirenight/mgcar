Her long, bejeweled fingers traced the air above each card, absorbing their energy. The silver bangles on her wrists jingled softly with each movement.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she spoke in her rich, accented voice, her eyes lifting to meet Melissa's. \"These cards tell quite a story about Stefan's current situation.\" She gestured to the first card, the reversed Ten of Pentacles. \"This speaks of instability in his foundations - perhaps financial troubles or family discord. There's a sense of loss or upheaval in what he once considered secure.\"\n\nMoving to the reversed King of Cups, her expression grew more serious. \"This is particularly telling. The King of Cups reversed suggests emotional manipulation or instability. Stefan may be struggling with controlling his emotions, or perhaps he's dealing with someone who is emotionally manipulative. There's a lack of emotional maturity present.\"\n\nHer finger moved to the upright Page of Pentacles, and a slight smile crossed her face. \"However, this card brings a more positive energy. It suggests a new opportunity or learning experience, particularly in practical matters - perhaps a new job or educational pursuit. He's in a position to receive news or an offer.\"\n\nFinally, touching the Temperance card, she nodded slowly. \"Temperance upright is quite significant here. It speaks of the need for balance and moderation. The universe is suggesting that whatever turmoil Stefan is experiencing, the path forward requires patience and finding middle ground.\"\n\nLeaning back in her ornate chair, Madame Esmeralda folded her hands in her lap. \"Together, these cards paint a picture of someone going through a period of significant change.
