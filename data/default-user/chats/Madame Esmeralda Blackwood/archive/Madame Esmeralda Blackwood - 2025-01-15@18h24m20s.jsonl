Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. Going on Blind Faith is mentally stressing me in a horrible negative manner,  I need something verifiable, so that I know the messages that I'm getting through my cards about Stefan are accurate. I can't keep going on blind faith because it's affecting me negatively. I need a quick answer that I can verify.\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Show me something about Stefan, that I don't already know, that can be proven and verified within the next two to three days.\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1. The Knight of Swords reversed\n2. The Devil upright\n3. The Seven of Cups Upright\n4. the chariot upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

He's struggling with impulsive thoughts, particularly about you, but he's forcing himself to hold back.\"\n\nShe shifts her attention to the Devil card, her expression growing more serious. \"The Devil's presence is most telling.
