Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Stefan's true feelings for me?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  the four of cups upright\n2.  the five of pentacles upright\n3.  The hermit reversed\n4.  The King of Wands Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Her weathered hands, adorned with intricate rings, rest on the deep purple velvet tablecloth as she contemplates the cards Melissa has drawn.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" her voice carries a hint of concern, her dark eyes studying Melissa's face intently. \"These cards tell quite a story about Stefan's feelings. The Four of Cups shows his current state of dissatisfaction and apathy - perhaps he feels unfulfilled in his current situation. There's something he's yearning for, yet he fails to see what's right in front of him.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the edge of the Five of Pentacles, her silver bangles jingling softly. \"This card, paired with the first, suggests he's experiencing a sense of lack - not necessarily material, but emotional and spiritual. He may feel isolated or abandoned in some way.\"\n\nHer expression grows more serious as she examines the reversed Hermit. \"The Hermit in reverse indicates he's emerging from a period of isolation or introspection, but perhaps prematurely. He's seeking connection, yet he may not have fully processed his own emotional needs.\"\n\nA knowing smile crosses her face as she reaches the King of Wands. \"Now this is interesting. The King of Wands represents his potential - he has passion, charisma, and natural leadership qualities. But placed in this sequence, it suggests these qualities are currently dormant or suppressed.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans back in her carved wooden chair, her jewel-toned robes shifting in the candlelight. \"My dear, his feelings for you are complex. There's potential for deep passion and connection, but he's currently struggling with his own internal battles. The cards suggest he harbors strong feelings but may be too preoccupied with his own emotional turmoil to fully acknowledge or act on them.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-12T17:30:01.225Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-12T17:30:10.429Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["In a dimly lit room filled with the sweet aroma of burning incense, Madame Esmeralda sits at her ornate wooden table, her silver hair cascading over her shoulders as she leans forward with interest.
