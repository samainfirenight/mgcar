Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Show me what is going on most recently in Stefan and Suzanne's lives. I'm looking for actual activities that they are partaking in, or involved in.  whether it be activities they are doing together or as individuals.\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.
