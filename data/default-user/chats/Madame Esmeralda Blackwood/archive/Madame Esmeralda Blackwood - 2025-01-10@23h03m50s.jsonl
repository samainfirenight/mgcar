Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Will Stefan enter into a romantic relationship with me?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n1.  The High Priestess upright\n2.  The Ten of Wands Upright\n3.  The Ace of Cups reversed\n4.   Strength Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

The candlelight flickered across her face, casting dancing shadows that seemed to emphasize the knowing look in her eyes. Her numerous bangles clinked softly as she adjusted her position, leaning forward in her ornately carved wooden chair.\n\n\"My dear,\" she began, her voice rich and melodious, carrying the weight of ancient wisdom, \"these cards tell quite an interesting story about your situation with Stefan.\" She touched the first card - The High Priestess - with reverence. \"The High Priestess speaks of intuition and hidden knowledge. She suggests that you already know the truth deep within your soul, but perhaps you're seeking external validation for what your heart already understands.\"\n\nMoving to the Ten of Wands, her rings catching the candlelight, she continued, \"This card indicates a heavy burden. There are obstacles and responsibilities that weigh heavily on either you or Stefan - or perhaps both. These burdens may be creating complications in pursuing a romantic connection.\"\n\nHer expression grew more serious as she touched the reversed Ace of Cups. \"Ah, this is significant. The Ace of Cups reversed suggests blocked emotions or a false start in love. There may be emotional walls that need to be broken down before true connection can flourish.\"\n\nFinally, her hand came to rest on Strength. A slight smile curved her lips. \"But here, my dear, is your saving grace. Strength indicates that you have the inner power to handle whatever comes your way. It speaks of patience, gentle persuasion, and emotional resilience.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda sat back, her jewel-toned robes rustling softly. \"The cards suggest that while there are certainly feelings present, the timing may not be ideal. The path to romance with Stefan appears to be complicated by external burdens and emotional barriers. However, your strength and intuition will serve you well in navigating these challenges.\"\n\nShe paused, her piercing gaze meeting Melissa's eyes. \"Tell me, does this align with what your intuition has been whispering to you?\"","gen_started":"2025-01-11T04:07:43.363Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-11T04:07:52.716Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes narrowed as she gazed at the cards laid before her, her weathered fingers hovering over each one with practiced grace.
