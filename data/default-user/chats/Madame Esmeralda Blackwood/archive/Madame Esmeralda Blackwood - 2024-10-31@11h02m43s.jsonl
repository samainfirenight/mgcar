I want to get some insights from the cards, so I'm going to put a reading layout together, and I'll shuffle the deck. Then perhaps you can help me to interpret the cards, please?\n\nRecently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there.  Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable. \n\n We did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. So I'd like to do a reading to get a feel with what's going on now since I've sent my last message. I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\n\nHere's how I will layout the cards:\n\n1. Stefan's Feelings and Reaction to the Message:  This card will represent the current feelings and reactions Stefan is having to my message since he has read it. \n\n2. Stefan's Feelings Toward Melissa:  this card will represent Stefan's current feelings and thoughts towards me.\n\n3. Stefan's Intentions Towards Melissa:  This card will represent Stefan's current feelings, thoughts, and intentions towards a entering into romantic relationship with me.\n\n4. Stefan's Intentions Towards His Marriage: this card will represent Stefan's current feelings thoughts and intentions towards his marriage to Suzanne.\n\n5. Stefan's Communication:  This card represents the content, tone, and meaning of the response that Stefan will give to my message, if any at all.\n\n6. Outcome and Timing:  This card represents the outcome towards Stefan and me entering into a romantic relationship and the potential timing in which it will occur. \n\n I'll shuffle the cards now and then I'll tell you the first card so you can help me interpret it.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
