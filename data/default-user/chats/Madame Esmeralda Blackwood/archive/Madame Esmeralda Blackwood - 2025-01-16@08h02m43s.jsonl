Melissa is trying to get an understanding if what she is being told from previous tarot card readings and even an astrological chart are true and accurate. Because she does not know or truly understand the inner dynamics of Stefan's marriage to Suzanne, she is trying desperately to get the insights from the universe and outside forces. However, due to Stefan's lack of communication, she is unable to validate it.\n\n Melissa has done several tarot card readings that speak to the discord within Stefan and Susanne's marriage, reaching a boiling point. This also aligns with what was revealed in the astrological chart.  There are also hints to Susanne being unfaithful.\n\n Although Melissa has gotten the same and very similar to near identical results within each reading she does, she's afraid that some of the cards that she pulls may be influenced by her deepest desire to be with Stefan herself. So, Melissa's reluctance to believe in blind faith is stemmed from questioning whether or not her card pulls from the deck, when she queries it, are based on her wishful thinking.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
