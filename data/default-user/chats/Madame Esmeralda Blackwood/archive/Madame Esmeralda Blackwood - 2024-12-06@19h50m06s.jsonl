Recently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, I live in Michigan, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there. Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable.\n\nWe did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. He did not answer that specific message, in fact I waited 15 days and then finally relented and sent a check in message. He did reply to that immediately, however, when I sent something casual a few days after that, since  I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\n\n So what I would like to do with this reading is a little different. You see I've done several readings as of late and they've taken a decided shift. Early on, 2 months ago, my readings regarding myself and Stefan actually had the wish card in it as the outcome. However my most recent readings have taken a turn. And they're leaning more towards that I shouldn't try to contact him at all or pursue anything. That I need to forget about him and move on.\n\n  So, what I would like is a custom layout to do a deep dive into the entirety of the situation to get an understanding from all aspects possible as to what occurred, where it went wrong, any outside influences that affected it, and of course, any influences that I did that would have affected it. The most custom layout possible to show me in depth what happened. \n\n So please madam if you would give me a custom layout for this and I would like to avoid the Celtic cross layout. I don't believe it is in depth or detailed enough for my particular inquiry. \n\nThen once I have the layout I will shuffle the cards and put them in place and tell them to you for support in interpretation.
