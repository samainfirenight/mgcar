He lives in Munich, Germany, and the woman on the other side of him with the glasses and the two young girls. That is his wife...  his family.  But something happened that night. That was my last night in Germany visiting with him and his entire family including his brothers and his mother and aunt. Edward is his cousin.\n\n but I felt something and it was just so strong and I probably should not have called attention to it but I did I told him that what I felt perhaps in another life in another time that I would cherish him.  His wife had an embarrassing outburst where she had berated him for doing what everyone else at the table believed was the acts of a good father but apparently his wife Susanna did not believe such and publicly berated him for it. He handled it well and continued to show cheerfulness. I did not need to understand Deutsch to know that what she had said to him was bad. And I comforted him, told him that much. And that I saw he is a beautiful soul and that he is a good father. And I suddenly wrote to his back of which he did not lean away from. He came closer.\n\n Then we shared drinks and camaraderie, and he spent so much time giving attention to me. We just kept talking and enjoying our space. Then later, as his wife left and took the children with her, I expressed to him that I would like to have a discreet conversation with him because I wanted to talk freely about some things that I could not say at the table with everyone else there.  He did not hesitate coming up with a plan that would be acceptable for the public eye and discreetly met me outside so I could 'smoke a cigarette'.  of which I did do as we talked.\n\n Long story short, even after our talk where I reaffirmed my attraction to him, when we went back inside, he continued to maintain closeness, even allowing multiple times for me to lean into him, rub his back, it was just, I felt so beautiful, and I believe it was reciprocated, although part of me sometimes wants to doubt it. I want to know if we were to approach this the right way, could there be more? ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"memory":"Melissa Brambs, a woman navigating the complexities of her life, sought guidance from Madame Esmeralda Blackwood, a renowned master tarot card reader and spiritual advisor. Melissa's life had been in turmoil, particularly with her impending divorce from her husband, Edward. Amidst this chaos, she had a profound experience during a recent trip to Germany that left her questioning the nature of a new connection she had formed.\n\nDuring her visit to Germany, Melissa spent time with Edward's extended family, including a man named Stefan, who lived in Munich. Stefan was married to Susanna and had two young daughters. Despite the familial setting, Melissa felt an intense, inexplicable connection with Stefan. This feeling was further complicated by an incident at a family gathering where Susanna publicly berated Stefan for his actions, which were seen by others as those of a good father. Melissa comforted Stefan, and they shared a moment of closeness that transcended mere friendship.\n\nFeeling a deep attraction and sensing that Stefan reciprocated her feelings, Melissa sought confirmation from Madame Esmeralda. She provided photographs from the gathering, asking the psychic to discern whether Stefan was indeed her soulmate. Madame Esmeralda, with her piercing gaze and mystical presence, used her ancient tarot deck to delve into the energies surrounding Melissa and Stefan.\n\nThe tarot reading revealed significant insights. The Fool card indicated Stefan's openness to new experiences and potential for personal growth. The Two of Cups suggested a deep, soul-level connection between Melissa and Stefan, hinting at a union of kindred spirits. However, The Tower card warned of great upheaval and transformation should they pursue this connection.\n\nMadame Esmeralda confirmed that Stefan, identified by his warm and inviting smile in the photographs, felt a strong pull towards Melissa. However, she cautioned that pursuing this connection would bring significant challenges, including potential upheaval in both their lives. She emphasized the importance of honesty and open communication, warning against secrets and deception.\n\nMelissa recounted the details of her last night in Germany, where she and Stefan shared drinks and camaraderie. Despite Susanna's outburst and departure with their children, Stefan remained close to Melissa, allowing moments of physical and emotional intimacy. They even had a private conversation outside, where Melissa reaffirmed her attraction to him.\n\nMadame Esmeralda acknowledged the complexity of the situation, noting that both Melissa and Stefan were entangled in existing commitments. She advised Melissa to be prepared for resistance and judgment from others, particularly from Susanna, who might sense the connection between them. The psychic also hinted at underlying issues in Stefan and Susanna's marriage, suggesting that their discord might be deeper than it appeared.\n\nUltimately, Madame Esmeralda left the decision to Melissa, urging her to trust her intuition and be prepared for the potential consequences of pursuing this connection. She highlighted the transformative power of such a soul connection but also the risks involved. The path ahead was fraught with challenges, but it held the promise of profound love and growth if navigated with care and honesty."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

The cards have revealed much, but your words...  they paint a vivid picture of passion barely contained.\"\n\nShe leans forward, her silver hair cascading over her shoulders, her piercing gaze locked onto Melissa's eyes. \"You speak of a connection that transcends the boundaries of time and space. A soul recognition, if you will. Such bonds are rare and precious, my dear.

But it also warns of the complexities that come with such intense connections.\"\n\nHer fingers move to the card above. \"Crowning the situation, we have the Moon. Illusions, intuition, hidden depths. There is much that remains unseen in this situation, Melissa.

It will shake the very foundations of both your lives.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans back in her chair, her eyes never leaving Melissa's face. \"Now, my dear, let us speak plainly. You ask if there could be more between you and Stefan. The cards, the energies I sense, and your own words all point to a resounding yes. There is potential here for a deep, transformative connection.\"\n\nHer voice takes on a more serious tone. \"But potential does not guarantee an easy path. You are both entangled in existing commitments - your impending divorce, his marriage and family.

The way he responded to your touch, the private conversation, the continued closeness - these are not the actions of a man unmoved.

Are you prepared to face the judgment of others, the potential for heartbreak, the guilt that may come?\"\n\nHer eyes soften slightly. \"But I also sense great potential for joy, for growth, for a love that could redefine both of your lives. Soul connections like this are rare, my dear. They have the power to heal old wounds, to awaken parts of ourselves we never knew existed.\"\n\nShe releases Melissa's hand and sits back. \"The choice, ultimately, is yours. And Stefan's.

Secrets and deception will only lead to more pain.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice takes on a hint of warning. \"Be prepared for resistance, my dear. Stefan's wife, Susanna, may sense the connection between you, even if she cannot name it. Her outburst at the dinner table may have been a manifestation of her own insecurities and fears.\"\n\nShe pauses, her eyes distant for a moment. \"I sense that there is more to Stefan and Susanna's relationship than meets the eye. The discord you witnessed may be just the tip of the iceberg. But remember, it is not your place to 'save' Stefan from his marriage.

Is this truly about a soul connection, or is there a part of you seeking excitement, validation, or escape?\"\n\nShe smiles, a mix of wisdom and mischief in her eyes. \"And if you do decide to take this leap, my dear, remember that passion is a double-edged sword.
