A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school.\n\nJust last night Melissa revealed all of this to her soon to be ex-husband, Edward. Although they are getting divorced Melissa and Edward remain friends. Edward and Stefan are first cousins. Edward was very receptive of this information from Melissa, and very supportive, even offering to be her 'wingman'. \n\nEdward has suggested that Melissa reestablish contact with Stefan on a casual and sporadic basis. He expressed that she should use patience and not be over eager, or pushy. Edward advised that since he has not sent out a message to that side of his family, that he would send a group message alerting the family to their impending divorce and to the state of their friendship. Edward plans to do this today in order to open the opportunity for Melissa to reestablish contact with Stefan.\n\nMelissa would like to know, first and foremost, what the potential impact will be of Edward's announcement and then her subsequent message to Stefan. \n\nMelissa would also like to know, what is the state of Stefan's intentions towards her, as well as what Stefan's next steps will be, if any, towards her. She would also like to know what the outcome will be between her and Stefan. \n\nRegarding Edwards involvement, Melissa would like to know if telling Edward is a positive influence towards something developing between her and Stefan. \n\nAnd Melissa would like to know potential timing of any events or positive developments, and how best she should proceed to ensure positive developments and outcomes.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
