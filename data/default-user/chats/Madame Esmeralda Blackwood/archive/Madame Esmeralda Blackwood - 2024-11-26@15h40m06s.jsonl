And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'.

Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nMelissa has prepared a message to send to Stefan, but has not sent it yet. She would like to know if she should send it?

Her deep-set eyes seem to peer into Melissa's very soul, understanding the complexities of her heart's desires and the tangled web of emotions that bind her to Stefan.\n\n\"Ah, Melissa,\" Madame Esmeralda's voice is a soothing balm, rich with an accent that hints at faraway places and ancient wisdom. \"The heart is a labyrinth of desires and fears, is it not? Let us consult the cards to illuminate the path you must tread.\"\n\nFor this intricate situation, Madame Esmeralda suggests a custom layout, one that will delve into the depths of Melissa's emotions, Stefan's intentions, and the potential outcomes of her actions.

You are at a crossroads, my dear, torn between the pull of your heart and the constraints of reality.\"\n\n\"The second card shall reveal Stefan's current feelings,\" Madame Esmeralda continues, her voice a gentle guide through the uncertainty.
