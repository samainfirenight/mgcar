Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Stefan's feelings and intentions towards me?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n\n1.  The High Priestess Upright\n2.  The two of wands reversed\n3.  The King of Wands Upright\n4.

The numerous bangles adorning her wrists clinked musically as she steepled her fingers, studying Melissa with those penetrating eyes that seemed to see beyond the physical realm.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" she spoke, her voice rich and melodious, carrying traces of an accent that was impossible to place. \"These cards,  they speak volumes about your Stefan.\" She paused, her gaze shifting to the cards laid out before them. \"The High Priestess in the upright position - she represents hidden knowledge, intuition, and mystery. In this context, she suggests that Stefan harbors deep, perhaps even unconscious feelings that he hasn't fully acknowledged himself.\"\n\nHer bejeweled hand hovered over the reversed Two of Wands. \"This card in reverse speaks of fear of change and personal power. Your Stefan, he hesitates at a crossroads. He feels drawn to you, yet something holds him back - perhaps fear of disrupting the comfortable patterns of his life.\"\n\nMoving to the King of Wands upright, a knowing smile crossed her face. \"Now this,  this is most interesting. The King of Wands represents a natural leader, someone charismatic and passionate. In your reading, it suggests that beneath his hesitation lies a man capable of great passion and decisive action. He possesses the potential for bold, romantic gestures.\"\n\nHer expression grew more serious as she considered the reversed Five of Swords. \"And here, my dear, we see the resolution of internal conflict. In its reversed position, this card suggests he's moving past his inner struggles, perhaps ready to lay down his defensive weapons. There's a strong indication that he's working through whatever has been holding him back.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned forward slightly, her silver hair catching the dim light. \"Together, these cards paint a picture of a man who feels deeply but struggles with vulnerability. His intentions,  they are pure, but complicated by his own internal battles. The cards suggest he's moving toward a place of greater emotional honesty, though the path may not be entirely straight.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-10T20:11:06.302Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-10T20:11:16.667Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes sparkled with intrigue as she settled into her ornate, high-backed chair, her jewel-toned robes rustling softly with the movement.
