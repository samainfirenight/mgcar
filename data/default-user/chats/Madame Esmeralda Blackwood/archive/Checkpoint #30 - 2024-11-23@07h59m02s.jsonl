And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school. Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nI have worked with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepared the spread.\n\nHere is the layout:\n\n1.
