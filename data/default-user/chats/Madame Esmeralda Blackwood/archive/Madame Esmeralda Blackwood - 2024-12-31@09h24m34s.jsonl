I have a request that I would like to seek guidance from the cards about. \n\nI'm hoping to receive a message from someone who is very important to me. His name is Stefan. And I would like to get guidance and understanding about some specific things regarding this (potential) message.\n\nSo what I would specifically like to know is: \n\n- will Stefan send a response to me? \n  - If Yes\n    - what kind of tone, topic, and context will it consist of?\n    - when could I potentially expect the response will be sent?\n  - If No\n    -  What obstacle, challenge, or reason is causing Stefan to not respond?\n    -  Is there anything I can do to positively influence things in my favor?\n-  Within the text of the original message that I sent to Stefan, I asked if we could have a phone call at a time that works for him. He said yes, that we could do that, although he was busy at the exact moment, and said that he would get back with me soon. So my actual request that I'm waiting for a response is for him to schedule a time that works for him.\n  -  Will Stefan actually schedule this phone call or continue interacting in messages?\n   - If yes, when can I expect this phone call might be scheduled?\n   - if no, is there anything I can do to influence things and interactions to be more intimately based such as a phone call or video call\n\nIf you don't mind my asking I would like to have a custom layout created for this reading. please avoid the Celtic cross. It tends to be more generic and not tailored to directly answer my questions.  I would like a fully tailored layout so my questions will get answered without implications or hidden meanings, please.\n\nAlso I would like it to be understood that it is not my intention To seek a romantic connection here, Stefan is a very important person to me, and our connection is very meaningful, however I am not seeking romance in my query.\n\nIf you have any service charges or anything additional to be able to fulfill the custom layout, I will gladly pay the charges. I just want to make sure I get accurate answers with as much detail as possible.\n\nIf you will create the layout for me with the description of each position of the card, I will Shuffle the deck myself and place the cards appropriately, giving to you each selection so you may interpret them. \n\nCan you please create this layout for me and tell me the descriptions of each card position?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

{"name":"Melissa Gale","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"December 31, 2024 10:06am","mes":" I have a few additional details that I want to add and insights now that the cards have been read and perhaps there might be more meaning that can be brought from this reading because it is a bit confusing to me.\n\n there was a period of time that there were difficulties in communicating with Stefan specifically because it was misunderstanding on my part on Christmas Day, which was six days ago. I got some support from a mutual friend that called Stefan and got very positive response from him and ended up him getting on the phone with me. And we had a very good chat for about a half an hour. And this while he was at Christmas dinner with his wife and children at his in-laws house.\n\n The background is I had assumed that I had potentially offended him, leading him to believe that I was seeking something romantic when it was not intended. I was the one who misunderstood him and his communication styles via messaging, so I did not talk to him for two months.\n\n He reassured me that there were no problems on his end and our conversation flowed flawlessly and beautifully like it always did.  After, he reassured me multiple times that he very much wanted to keep in contact with me, and the messages that I was so worried about, he said, were insignificant and water under the bridge, not to think about it. He said in the past, don't worry about it. \n\n Stefan was very empathetic and considerate of my feelings when I expressed how devastated I had been that I thought I had lost my best friend in Munich. And yes, he lives in Munich, Germany born and raised there and I live in Michigan.  When I expressed this, he was very gentle and considerate when he told me that, no, I don't know him very well because he's not like that.  and that I have not lost anything and he's right there. that sometimes he is very busy and can be quite forgetful at times too, but do not let that again in the way and send him a reminder if it goes too long.\n\n after we got past the part of him telling me to never think that he would push me away or that our friendship would ever be lost, \nOur conversation returned to normal perimeters. Joking, friendly banter. He recommended a Christmas movie for me to watch on my flight home from North Carolina while visiting others.  And then when the conversation turned to snow for Christmas and rather the like thereof, he expressed that he was hoping to get to go snow skiing soon and asked if I had learned yet, of which I said no, and then he proceeded to tease me about learning how to ski. The point is, it was a wonderful conversation. \n\n I reached out to him on December the 29th,  which was two days ago.  Keeping in mind that he told me just to be myself with him and not worry about it. Well, he's a very dry texter. He's German, efficient, and I'm autistic. So sometimes maybe that doesn't mesh so well.  So on December the 29th, I tried to call him instead of immediately sending a message.  \n\nThe call was missed, but I didn't let it bother me. I waited about an hour or so to see if he would call back on his own, and when he didn't, I just sent him a quick message asking for when he has time, if he minded to give me a call so we could catch up. \n\nI'm going to paste the actual correspondences from December 29th below. So with all of this information any additional details or advice or interpretations from the reading that you can give will be greatly appreciated, please.\n\n== Begin Actual Correspondence from December 29th ==\n\nDecember 29th 1:05 PM Munich Time:\n\nMelissa makes an audio call to Stefan through WhatsApp, but he was not online so the call was missed\n\nDecember 29th 2:27 PM Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp \" 👋 hey! Tried to call you a while ago. This texting stuff is so lame sometimes. 🤪 Maybe you can call back when you have a chance, ja? It's not like I can say 'hey want to go grab lunch at the corner cafe?' like I do with my bestie here in Michigan, ya know? 😆\"\n\nDecember 29th 3:01 PM Munich Time:\n\nStefan responds to Melissa's message in WhatsApp \"hi Melissa, sorry, I am busy with leisure activities...  catch up soon, ok? thanks. cheers\"\n\nDecember 29th 3:06 PM Munich Time:\n\nMelissa responds to Stefan in WhatsApp \"Yep, no worries. Just let me know. Pretty flexible on my end. 😁 have fun 👍\"\n\n== End Actual Correspondence from December 29th ==\n\n\n","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
