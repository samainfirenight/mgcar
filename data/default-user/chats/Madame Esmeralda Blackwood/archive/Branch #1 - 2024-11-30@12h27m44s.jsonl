A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school. Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nMelissa has been maintaining distance since then. She, at least, believes is the right thing - to give Stefan space to process. She's not so versed in German culture but she does understand the methodical approach that most German men will take towards emotional matters.\n\nWith that being said Melissa's request for her reading is: Melissa would like to know what the universe has planned for her and Stefan. Is it a romantic relationship, or something else? What actions, specifically, is the universe taking towards the intended outcome for Melissa and Stefan?  What obstacles are hindering the process, if any? What actions does Melissa need to take? And finally, what is the expected timing for the outcome to manifest?\n\nMelissa has asked to please avoid the celtic cross layout as she doesn't feel it's intimate enough to dive deeply into her request. So she asked if you can create a custom layout for her inquiry.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
