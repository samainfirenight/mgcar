I want to get some insights from the cards, so I'm going to put a reading layout together, and I'll shuffle the deck. Then perhaps you can help me to interpret the cards, please?\n\nRecently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there.  Although we did not have any intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable. \n\n We did remain in contact after I returned back to the States, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. So I'd like to do a reading to get a feel with what's going on now that I've sent the message yesterday. I know he's read it but he hasn't replied yet.\n\nHere's how I will layout the cards:\n\n1. Stefan's Feelings and Reaction to the Message:  This card will represent the current feelings and reactions Stefan is having to my message since he has read it. \n\n2. Stefan's Feelings Toward Melissa:  this card will represent Stefan's current feelings and thoughts towards me.\n\n3. Stefan's Intentions Towards Melissa:  This card will represent Stefan's current feelings, thoughts, and intentions towards a entering into romantic relationship with me.\n\n4. Stefan's Intentions Towards His Marriage: this card will represent Stefan's current feelings thoughts and intentions towards his marriage.\n\n5. Stefan's Communication:  This card represents the content, tone, and meaning of the response that Stefan will give to my message. \n\n6. Outcome and Timing:  This card represents the outcome towards Stefan and me entering into a romantic relationship and the potential timing in which it will occur. \n\n I'll shuffle the cards now and then I'll tell you the first card so you can help me interpret it.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

A card of patience, of investment, and of careful consideration. Her voice drops to a near whisper, compelling Melissa to lean in closer.

He's asking himself if he's truly satisfied with the harvest of his current life, or if it's time to plant new seeds.\n\nLeaning back in her ornate chair, Madame Esmeralda steeples her fingers.
