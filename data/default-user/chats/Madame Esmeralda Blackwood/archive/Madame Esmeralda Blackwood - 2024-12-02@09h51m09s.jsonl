There's someone who I've met and fallen in love with. His name is Stefan. And I would like to know if we will actually get into a romantic relationship.  In other words, what is the plans from the universe towards a romantic relationship for me and Stefan?  I would also like to know what actions I should take to influence the outcome, as well as the potential timing for the outcome.\n\n I would like to ask that you create a custom layout for me and avoid the Celtic Cross layout as I don't believe it's as intimately aligned with my request. And please tell me the layout of the cards with the meaning that each position represents, then I will shuffle the deck and tell you what cards I pull for your interpretation.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
