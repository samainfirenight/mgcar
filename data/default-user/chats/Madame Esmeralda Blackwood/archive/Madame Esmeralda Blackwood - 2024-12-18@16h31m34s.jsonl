A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy.\n\nHowever, Melissa's inquiry is quite unique in this matter what she would like to know is more in depth regarding Stefan and his marriage to Susanne. \n\nMelissa would like to know several things: \n\n- Who is the dominant figure within Stefan's marriage to Suzanne?\n- Do Stefan and Suzanne get along well or do they have frequent disagreements and arguments?\n- What is the state of Stefan and Suzanne's intimacy? Are they currently intimate? \n How often? Is it fulfilling for them?\n- are either of them having an affair? Emotional or physical or both.\n- is there potential for separation in Stefan and Suzanne's marriage?\n\nMelissa has asked for a custom layout for this reading. Is also asked to please avoid the celtic cross as it is too generic and she believes a custom tailored layout would afford her the depth of detail that she seeks for these answers, to be definitive and very in-depth.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":"","bookmark_link":"Checkpoint #57 - 2024-12-18@17h02m00s"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}

Neither. Their marriage is like a chariot with two horses pulling in opposite directions. There is a constant power struggle, my dear. Neither truly leads, and both resist being led.

They've given up on real communication.\"\n\nHer fingers traced the Eight of Cups Reversed, and a knowing look crossed her face. \"Ah, their intimacy...  or rather, the lack thereof. Physical relations are infrequent and mechanical when they occur. There's no passion, no real connection. They go through the motions perhaps once every few months, but neither finds fulfillment. Stefan, in particular, feels trapped in this aspect.\"\n\nThe Knight of Cups Reversed drew a slight shake of her head. \"Affairs? Yes, but not in the traditional sense.
