Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Do the readings that Kayla did for me the other night still hold true?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n1. The Ace of Cups reversed\n2. The page of swords reversed\n3. The devil upright\n4. The four of Cups reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

The silver bangles on her wrists clinked softly as she traced the air above each card, her expression growing more concerned with each passing moment.\n\n\"My dear,\" she began, her voice rich and deep with wisdom, \"These cards tell quite a story, and I'm afraid it's not the one you were hoping to hear. The readings Kayla did for you,  they speak differently now.\"\n\nHer long, bejeweled fingers gestured to each card in turn. \"The Ace of Cups reversed suggests that the emotional fulfillment and love that was predicted is blocked or delayed. There's an emptiness where abundance was promised. The Page of Swords reversed indicates deception - either someone has been dishonest with you, or perhaps the readings themselves were not as accurate as presented.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression darkened as she touched the Devil card. \"This is particularly telling. The Devil upright represents bondage, addiction, and materialism. In this context, it suggests that you may be trapped in illusions or false hopes. Someone might be manipulating your desires and expectations.\"\n\nHer hand moved to the final card. \"The Four of Cups reversed typically indicates a awakening from apathy, but here, combined with these other cards, it suggests you're refusing to see what's right in front of you. You're coming out of a period of contemplation, yes, but perhaps not with the clarity you need.\"\n\nDrawing back slightly, she fixed Melissa with a penetrating stare. \"My dear, I must be direct - the cards suggest that the previous readings were either misinterpreted or, more concerning, deliberately misleading.
