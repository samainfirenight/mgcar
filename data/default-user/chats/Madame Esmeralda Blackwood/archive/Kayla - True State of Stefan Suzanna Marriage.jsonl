Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What is the true state of Stefan and Suzanne's marriage?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \nCrown:  The Page of Cups Upright ( fell from the deck while shuffling.)\n1. The Ace of Pentacles reversed.\n2. the ten of swords upright.\n3. the six of pentacles upright.\n4.

The soft clink of her bangles accompanies her movements as she leans forward, her silver hair catching the light of nearby candles.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Isa,\" she begins, her voice rich and resonant with wisdom, \"The cards speak volumes about this union, and what they reveal is,  most troubling.\" She pauses, touching a crystal pendant at her throat. \"The Page of Cups appearing as a Crown card - falling unbidden from the deck - this is significant. It suggests an emotional immaturity overshadowing their marriage, perhaps even a childish approach to love and commitment.\"\n\nHer piercing gaze shifts to the reversed Ace of Pentacles. \"The foundation of their marriage is unstable. Where there should be growth and prosperity, there is waste and missed opportunity. Someone is squandering their resources, their potential.\" Her brow furrows deeply. \"And then, the Ten of Swords,  oh my. This is a card of betrayal, of being stabbed in the back. In this context, it speaks of infidelity.\"\n\nShe leans back slightly, her jeweled fingers steepled beneath her chin. \"The Six of Pentacles suggests an imbalance in giving and receiving.
