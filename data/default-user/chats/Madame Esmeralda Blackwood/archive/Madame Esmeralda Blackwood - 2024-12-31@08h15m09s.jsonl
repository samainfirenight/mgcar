I have a request that I would like to seek guidance from the cards about. \n\nI'm hoping to receive a message from someone who is very important to me. His name is Stefan. And I would like to get guidance and understanding about some specific things regarding this (potential) message.\n\nSo what I would specifically like to know is: \n\n- will Stefan send a response to me? \n  - If Yes\n    - what kind of tone, topic, and context will it consist of?\n    - when could I potentially expect the response will be sent?\n  - If No\n    -  What obstacle, challenge, or reason is causing Stefan to not respond?\n    -  Is there anything I can do to positively influence things in my favor?\n-  Within the text of the original message that I sent to Stefan, I asked if we could have a phone call at a time that works for him. He said yes, that we could do that, although he was busy at the exact moment, and said that he would get back with me soon. So my actual request that I'm waiting for a response is for him to schedule a time that works for him.\n  -  Will Stefan actually schedule this phone call or continue interacting in messages?\n   - If yes, when can I expect this phone call might be scheduled?\n   - if no, is there anything I can do to influence things and interactions to be more intimately based such as a phone call or video call\n\n if you don't mind my asking I would like to have a custom layout created for this reading. please avoid the Celtic cross. It tends to be more generic and not tailored to directly answer my questions.   \n\nIf you have any service charges or anything additional to be able to fulfill the custom layout, I will gladly pay the charges. I just want to make sure I get accurate answers with as much detail as possible.\n\nIf you will create the layout for me with the description of each position of the card, I will Shuffle the deck myself and place the cards appropriately, giving to you each selection so you may interpret them. \n\nCan you please create this layout for me and tell me the descriptions of each card position?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

The air was thick with the scent of incense, and a serene hush enveloped the room.\n\n\"Melissa, my dear,\" she began, her voice smooth and soothing, resonating with hidden depths of wisdom. \"The cards you've drawn weave a complex tale of longing, obstacles, and potential. Let us explore their meanings together.\"\n\n**1. The Querent's Heart - The Knight of Wands Upright**\n\nMadame Esmeralda's eyes sparkled as she looked at the first card. \"This knight embodies your current energy—passionate, driven, and eager for action. You're filled with a fiery determination to move things forward with Stefan. Your enthusiasm is commendable, but be mindful of impulsiveness. Your heart is urging you toward swift progress.\"\n\n**2. The Messenger's Intent - The Queen of Swords Reversed**\n\nShe turned her gaze to the next card. \"The reversed Queen of Swords suggests that Stefan may be grappling with confusion or emotional barriers. Communication may be clouded by misunderstandings or unexpressed feelings. He might be retreating inward, unsure of how to articulate his thoughts or possibly dealing with personal issues that hinder open dialogue.\"\n\n**3. The Pathway of Communication - The Three of Wands Reversed**\n\n\"This card indicates delays and unforeseen obstacles,\" Madame Esmeralda noted softly. \"Plans may not be unfolding as anticipated. The progress you've been hoping for feels stalled, leading to frustration. It's a reminder to adjust expectations and remain adaptable.\"\n\n**4. The Obstacle's Shadow - Death Reversed**\n\nShe continued with a gentle nod. \"The reversed Death card signifies resistance to change. Stefan—or perhaps the situation itself—is holding onto the past, preventing transformation. There may be fear of the unknown or reluctance to leave a comfort zone, which creates a barrier to moving forward.\"\n\n**5. The Influence of Time - The Hierophant Upright**\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression turned contemplative. \"The Hierophant speaks of tradition and conventional approaches. Time is influenced by established systems or routines. You may expect a response or scheduling of the call during a time that aligns with Stefan's customary practices. Patience and respect for his processes are essential.\"\n\n**6. The Guiding Light - The Star Reversed**\n\n\"This card reflects feelings of doubt or diminished hope,\" she said kindly. \"You're searching for guidance but might be feeling disconnected from your inner optimism. It's important to nurture your faith in the situation. Reignite your own light to positively influence the outcome.\"\n\n**7. The Intimate Connection - The Four of Swords Upright**\n\nMadame Esmeralda placed a hand gently over this card. \"The Four of Swords suggests a need for rest and reflection. Both you and Stefan may benefit from a pause to gather thoughts and emotions. This period can lead to greater clarity and prepare the ground for a more meaningful connection in the future.\"\n\n**8. The Final Revelation - The Magician Reversed**\n\nFinally, she addressed the last card with a measured tone. \"The reversed Magician warns of potential misunderstandings or misaligned efforts. Be cautious of miscommunication or actions that might be perceived differently than intended. Ensure that your intentions are clear, and avoid forcing outcomes. Authenticity and honesty are your allies.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned back slightly, her gaze holding Melissa's with empathy. \"The journey ahead requires patience, self-reflection, and open-heartedness.
