A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa had since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school. Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nMelissa has been doing what she believes to be the right thing since then. She had been giving Stefan space to process, and not making any effort to contact him.  However after talking with her husband Edward,  Melissa would find that What she had formally believed was not the case.\n\nOn Christmas Day Edward called Stefan And got a feel for the situation to find out that Stefan had no problems with Melissa at all.  After a few minutes of talking with Stefan himself, Edward put Melissa on the phone and she had a very long talk with Stefan.  Stefan cleared the air that he had zero issues with her, and her messages did not cause any problems - that she should not worry about it. When she expressed that she felt she had messed up their connection - their friendship, his exact words were, 'Nein Melissa. Then you don't know me that well yet. I am not like that.'\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of talking on the phone, even though he was at his in-law's house with his wife and children for Christmas,  Stefan expressed that he very much wanted Melissa to keep in contact and that she should not worry about it.  If ever he takes a while to get back to her, or sometimes just forgets because he has a lot of contacts, that she should just reach out to him again and give him a little reminder.  They had an overall very good Friendly talk About several different topics And the conversation flow was as if nothing had changed from their time spent in Munich.\n\nWith that being said Melissa's request for her reading is:  She would like to know what the overall status is between her and Stefan.  What is the outlook for their connection? Will it turn romantic? And when could she potentially see the outcome, either way? Is there anything she can do to help influence the connection to progress in her favor?\n\nMelissa has specifically asked to please avoid the celtic cross layout as she doesn't feel it's intimate enough to dive deeply into her request. So she asked if you can create a custom layout for her inquiry.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
