A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school. Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nMelissa has been doing the right thing since then of what she at least believes is the right thing and that is to give Stefan space to process she's not as overly versed in German culture but she does understand the methodical approach that most German men will use towards emotional matters.\n\nWith that being said Melissa's request for her reading is she would like to know if Stefan is thinking about her, and if he is thinking about her, are his and feelings romantic? She would also like to know what his intentions are and an approximate timeline on when a potential end of his processing will occur so that she can reestablish contact with him or vice versa.\n\nMelissa has specifically asked to please avoid the celtic cross layout as she doesn't feel it's intimate enough to dive deeply into her request. So she asked if you can create a custom layout for her inquiry.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
