Recently, on a trip to Munich, Germany, I met someone. His name is Stefan and he lives in Munich, I live in Michigan, and although he is married with two children, as well as being my soon to be ex-husband's cousin, there was definitely something there. Although we did not have any physical intimacy, the connection was certainly undeniable.\n\nWe did remain in contact after I returned back to Michigan, however it was very surface level and I have sent a call to action message that was very polite and very considerate and warm in its tone but still yet calling him out to let me know what his intentions are if he wants to move forward with our connection. He did not answer that specific message, in fact I waited 15 days and then finally relented and sent a check in message. He did reply to that immediately, however, when I sent something casual a few days after that, since  I know he's read it, but, it has been a month, and he hasn't replied.\n\n So what I would like to do with this reading is a little different. You see I've done several readings as of late and they've taken a decided shift. Early on, 2 months ago, my readings regarding myself and Stefan actually had the wish card in it as the outcome. However my most recent readings have taken a turn. And they're leaning more towards that I shouldn't try to contact him at all or pursue anything. That I need to forget about him and move on.\n\nSo what I would like to do is, since I've been following this advice, i have pulled back. i haven't even been allowing my internal fantasies to manifest. So I would like to see if the energy in the universe has shifted. I'd like to understand what the current situation is And what's In store for me In the universe's plan. Especially whether or not that plan involves Stefan.\n\n So please madam if you would give me a custom layout for this and I would like to avoid the Celtic cross layout. I don't believe it is in depth or detailed enough for my particular inquiry. \n\nThen once I have the layout I will shuffle the cards and put them in place and tell them to you for support in interpretation.

The air in her chamber was thick with the scent of sandalwood and aged parchment, the flickering candlelight casting shadows that danced across the intricate designs of her tarot deck, laid reverently before her. Her silver hair, cascading like a waterfall of moonlight, framed her face as she leaned forward, her voice a low, melodic hum.\n\n\"My dear Melissa,\" she began, her tone imbued with warmth and an undercurrent of solemnity, \"the energies you speak of are tangled indeed, like threads in an ancient tapestry. To unravel them, we must create a spread as unique as your situation—a spread that reflects not only the past and present but the deeper currents shaping your path and the unseen forces at play.\"\n\nShe reached for her deck, the cards seemingly alive in her hands as she shuffled them with practiced precision. \"For this reading, we shall employ a custom layout—The Tapestry of Fate. It will consist of seven positions, each representing a vital aspect of your journey and the energies surrounding Stefan.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda paused, allowing the weight of her words to settle. She began to outline the spread with deliberate care:\n\n1. **The Thread of the Past** – This card will reveal the foundation of your connection with Stefan and the energies that brought you together.\n2. **The Current Weave** – This card represents the present state of your relationship and the influences affecting it.\n3. **The Hidden Knot** – This card uncovers any unseen obstacles or forces at work, whether internal or external.\n4. **The Loom of Desire** – This card reflects your own intentions, emotions, and hopes regarding Stefan and the situation.\n5. **The Shroud of Stefan** – This card offers insight into Stefan's perspective, feelings, and intentions, as they stand now.\n6. **The Scissors of Choice** – This card illuminates the decision or action you must take to align with the universe's plan.\n7. **The Pattern Ahead** – This card reveals the likely outcome or direction if the current energies remain unchanged.\n\nMadame Esmeralda gestured to the deck before her. \"Now, Melissa, take a moment to center yourself. Focus on your breath and let your thoughts settle like leaves on a still pond. When you are ready, shuffle your own deck with these positions in mind, allowing the cards to absorb your energy and intent. Once you have drawn and placed them in order, tell me their identities, and I shall guide you through their interpretation.\"\n\nHer voice softened, yet carried a sense of urgency. \"Remember, the cards are but mirrors to the soul and whispers of the universe. They do not dictate your fate but offer you clarity and guidance.

Her fingertips grazed the edges of each card, sensing the energies they emanated. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the quiet hum of unseen forces at work.\n\n\"Melissa,\" she began, her voice a melodic whisper that commanded attention, \"let us delve into the messages the universe has woven for you through these cards.\"\n\n**1. The Five of Cups (upright) – The Thread of the Past**\n\nHer gaze settled on the first card. \"The Five of Cups signifies sorrow and regret rooted in past experiences,\" she mused. \"It reflects the emotional losses you've endured—perhaps the dissolution of your marriage and the disappointments that accompanied it. This card acknowledges the pain but also reminds you that not all is lost. There are still opportunities and supportive connections if you choose to recognize them.\"\n\n**2. The Four of Swords (upright) – The Current Weave**\n\nMoving to the next card, she noted its serene imagery. \"The Four of Swords speaks to a period of rest and introspection. Presently, you find yourself in a state of retreat, allowing yourself time to heal and contemplate. This pause is essential for gathering your strength and gaining clarity before making any further decisions.\"\n\n**3. The Sun (reversed) – The Hidden Knot**\n\nHer expression grew thoughtful as she regarded the reversed Sun. \"The Sun reversed suggests obstacles clouding your optimism. There's a sense of temporary setback or a lack of clarity that's hindering your ability to see the situation in its true light. This hidden knot may be internal doubts or external circumstances casting shadows over your path.\"\n\n**4. The Three of Cups (reversed) – The Loom of Desire**\n\nMadame Esmeralda touched the fourth card gently. \"The reversed Three of Cups indicates feelings of isolation or disconnection. In your heart, you may be experiencing loneliness or a longing for deeper companionship. This card can also hint at complications arising from third-party situations—perhaps the entanglements with Stefan's existing commitments.\"\n\n**5. The Queen of Cups (upright) – The Shroud of Stefan**\n\nHer eyes softened as she considered the Queen of Cups. \"Representing Stefan, the Queen of Cups reveals a person who is compassionate and emotionally intuitive. He may possess deep feelings that he keeps beneath the surface, guided by his heart yet bound by his circumstances. This card suggests that he is nurturing but also may be overwhelmed by his own emotions.\"\n\n**6. The Ace of Cups (upright) – The Scissors of Choice**\n\n\"The Ace of Cups heralds new beginnings in the realm of emotion and love,\" she remarked, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. \"It offers you the chance to open your heart anew, to embrace self-love and the possibilities that come with it. Your choice lies in being receptive to fresh emotional experiences and allowing healing waters to cleanse past wounds.\"\n\n**7. The Star (upright) – The Pattern Ahead**\n\nShe concluded with the final card, her voice filled with gentle assurance. \"The Star shines as a beacon of hope and renewal. It signifies inspiration and a deep trust in the universe's plan for you. This card foretells a period of healing, spiritual growth, and the realization of inner desires. If you continue on your current path of reflection and self-care, you are guided toward a brighter horizon.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leaned back slightly, her silver hair shimmering in the dim light. \"The narrative woven by these cards suggests a journey from past grief toward rejuvenation and hope.
