Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: How does Stefan view me? Is it strictly friends, or is it romantic?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  The Queen of Wands Upright\n2.  The Emperor Upright\n3.  The King of Pentacles reversed\n4. The ten of Swords reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

The candlelight flickered, casting dancing shadows across her weathered features as she traced her bejeweled fingers over each card with practiced reverence. The air in her dimly lit reading room grew thick with incense as she contemplated the spread before her.\n\n\"My dear,\" she began, her voice rich and melodious, carrying the weight of ancient wisdom, \"these cards tell quite an interesting story about Stefan's feelings toward you.\" She adjusted her deep purple shawl, the golden threads woven throughout catching the light as she moved.\n\n\"The Queen of Wands speaks of how he sees you - as a vibrant, passionate woman full of creative energy and determination. He admires your confidence and your natural ability to draw others to you.\" Her rings clinked softly against the table as she moved to the next card. \"This Queen also suggests that he finds you incredibly attractive and is drawn to your natural charisma.\"\n\nPausing to light another stick of incense, she continued, \"The Emperor appearing next is quite telling. It shows that Stefan possesses strong feelings that he keeps under strict control. He maintains a formal facade, perhaps out of respect for existing boundaries or fear of disrupting the current dynamic between you.\"\n\nHer dark eyes narrowed as she studied the reversed King of Pentacles. \"Ah, here we see his inner conflict. In this reversed position, it suggests he struggles with taking risks, particularly in matters of the heart. He may be too focused on maintaining stability and security to act on his feelings.\"\n\nFinally, her attention turned to the Ten of Swords reversed. A knowing smile curved her painted lips. \"This is particularly interesting, my dear. The Ten of Swords reversed indicates that whatever pain or difficulty existed in the past is ending. It suggests that Stefan is ready to move beyond his previous hesitations or fears.\"\n\nLeaning forward, her numerous necklaces softly chiming, she fixed Melissa with an intense gaze. \"To answer your question directly - Stefan's feelings are far from merely friendly. There is definite romantic interest, but he has been carefully containing these emotions. The cards suggest that this period of restraint is coming to an end.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-11T04:36:29.300Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-11T04:36:40.122Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes widened slightly as she gazed upon the cards laid out before her.
