Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Is my own deeply ingrained desire to be with Stefan influencing the cards that I pull to make my readings inaccurate when I query about him?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:  \n1. The King of Pentacles reversed\n2. The Page of Pentacles Upright\n3. The Six of Swords reversed\n4.

I'm the one who shuffles the deck and pulls the actual cards, and that's what I'm concerned about. \n\nThat when I pull the actual cards, because I'm autistic and sometimes it's hard to focus my mind properly - objectively. I want to know if that is causing me to get false readings because I'm not pulling the right cards to begin with. I don't want to know about me and Stefan in this reading. I have no desire to know about that. I want to know if I am pulling the correct cards from the deck.

{"name":"Melissa Gale","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"January 15, 2025 6:21pm","mes":" Yes, yes, that's it. It's through the shuffling process and staying focused. I keep practicing and keep practicing but I still tend to lose that focus. I feel like I'm getting better at it. But my goal is to be a 100%.\n\n So I guess part of my uncertainty stems from like this. For instance, I can do readings for other things. Other things that I know are verifiable and I've been able to pull pretty accurate cards for those. And perhaps my lack of focus could be due to self-doubt. Partly because the true reason I'm using the cards is to maintain some level of insight and connection to Stefan while he works through his issues in his own life that are preparing him for me.\n\n Since I've already met him, I'm in love with him, but he doesn't know that, at least I haven't told him directly. We're good friends, however, I don't get to hear from him that often and it weighs heavy on me when that happens. I don't have any other means to know what might be going on in his life because he doesn't live near me, he lives very, very far away, in Germany to be in fact. So my only insight to know what's going on is through the cards and I need them to be right and some of the things that I've been told on multiple readings, actually nearly every reading that I do for him, I keep getting the same thing over and over again, telling me that there's a day of reckoning coming in his marriage, that his wife is cheating on him and that the marriage is coming to an end soon, but I don't see that so much on the outside, so it makes me doubt because I can't verify it and I can't directly ask him that. We're not that close, not yet. Does this all make sense now, why I need something that tells me that I'm getting my readings right?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
