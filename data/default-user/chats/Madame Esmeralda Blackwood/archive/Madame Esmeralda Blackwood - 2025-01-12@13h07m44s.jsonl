Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Stefan's true intentions with me? (first card is the answer,  The other four cards support and add context.)\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1.  the two of cups upright\n2.  The Queen of Swords reversed\n3.
