Is Suzanne currently involved in an affair? The answer, my dear, is a resounding yes.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's gaze shifted to the crown cards that had fallen during the shuffle. \"The Emperor reversed and the Nine of Pentacles reversed as crown cards are most telling. They speak of a man in Suzanne's life who holds power but abuses it. This could be her husband, Stefan, or perhaps a lover in a position of authority. The reversed Nine of Pentacles suggests a loss of independence and self-sufficiency. Suzanne may feel trapped or financially dependent, which could be a driving force behind her actions.\"\n\nHer attention then turned to the main spread. \"The Fool upright as the first card is significant. It represents new beginnings, taking risks, and embarking on a journey. In this context, it suggests that Suzanne has indeed started a new romantic adventure, throwing caution to the wind.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice took on a more serious tone. \"The Six of Swords upright follows, indicating a transition or journey.

Reversed, it suggests a lack of long-term planning. Suzanne may be caught up in the passion of the moment, not considering the future implications of her actions.\"\n\nA small smile played on Madame Esmeralda's lips as she regarded the final card. \"The Six of Wands upright is a card of victory and recognition. In this context, it suggests that Suzanne feels a sense of triumph or validation in her affair.
