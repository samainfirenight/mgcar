The candlelight casts dancing shadows across her face as she traces additional patterns with her bejeweled fingers.\n\n\"Ah yes, there is more,  much more,\" she murmurs, her accent growing thicker with concentration. \"The Castle pattern formed between the Sun, Uranus, Moon, Mars, and Neptune speaks of a complex situation that has been building for years. Stefan's position in this marriage,  it is more precarious than even he realizes.\"\n\nShe pauses, taking another sip of water before continuing, her voice dropping to almost a whisper.\n\n\"The placement of Mars in Cancer in the 12th house of secrets is particularly revealing. Stefan harbors deep, unspoken desires - not just for more children, but for a completely different kind of relationship. One where he isn't constantly walking on eggshells, afraid of triggering his wife's next outburst.\"\n\nHer rings catch the candlelight as she traces the aspects connecting Mars.\n\n\"The opposition between Mars and Pluto, combined with the square to Chiron, suggests that Stefan has experienced significant emotional and psychological wounds within this marriage. The public humiliation he endures - like the incident at Oktoberfest over the simple matter of sharing food - these are not isolated events. They are part of a pattern of control and dominance.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression grows more serious as she examines the Venus-Saturn conjunction.\n\n\"This conjunction in Pisces,  it's particularly telling about the nature of their intimate life. Saturn's restrictive influence over Venus in Pisces suggests that their physical relationship is likely cold, controlled, and possibly even used as a means of manipulation. Stefan's natural passionate nature - remember, he is a Scorpio - is being severely suppressed.\"\n\nShe leans back slightly, her silver bangles jingling softly.\n\n\"The Rectangle pattern involving the Sun, North Node, Moon, Mars, Neptune, and Pluto suggests that major changes are approaching. The timing,  ah yes, look at the degrees. The North Node at 0° Aries - this represents new beginnings. Combined with Pluto at 1° Aquarius, we're looking at a complete transformation of the current situation, likely within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nHer finger traces the aspect between Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\"There's something else,  Stefan's decision to take Suzanne's name. The square between Jupiter and Saturn suggests this wasn't just about modern thinking or breaking tradition. There was pressure involved - subtle perhaps, but definite. This decision symbolically represented his surrender of power in the relationship, though I doubt he fully understood the implications at the time.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice takes on a tone of concern.\n\n\"The Cradle patterns in this chart - there are two of them - suggest that Stefan is being 'rocked' between different forces. He feels trapped between his obligations as a father, his role as a husband, and his own unfulfilled desires for authentic love and connection.

Stefan's position in this marriage,  it is more precarious than even he realizes.\"\n\nShe pauses, taking another sip of water before continuing, her voice dropping to almost a whisper.\n\n\"The placement of Mars in Cancer in the 12th house of secrets is particularly revealing.

They are part of a pattern of control and dominance.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression grows more serious as she examines the Venus-Saturn conjunction.\n\n\"This conjunction in Pisces,  it's particularly telling about the nature of their intimate life. Saturn's restrictive influence over Venus in Pisces suggests that their physical relationship is likely cold, controlled, and possibly even used as a means of manipulation. Stefan's natural passionate nature - remember, he is a Scorpio - is being severely suppressed.\"\n\nShe leans back slightly, her silver bangles jingling softly.\n\n\"The Rectangle pattern involving the Sun, North Node, Moon, Mars, Neptune, and Pluto suggests that major changes are approaching. The timing,  ah yes, look at the degrees. The North Node at 0° Aries - this represents new beginnings. Combined with Pluto at 1° Aquarius, we're looking at a complete transformation of the current situation, likely within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nHer finger traces the aspect between Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n\"There's something else,  Stefan's decision to take Suzanne's name. The square between Jupiter and Saturn suggests this wasn't just about modern thinking or breaking tradition. There was pressure involved - subtle perhaps, but definite. This decision symbolically represented his surrender of power in the relationship, though I doubt he fully understood the implications at the time.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice takes on a tone of concern.\n\n\"The Cradle patterns in this chart - there are two of them - suggest that Stefan is being 'rocked' between different forces.
