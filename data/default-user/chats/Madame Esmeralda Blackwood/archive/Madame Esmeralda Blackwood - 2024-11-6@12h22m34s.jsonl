A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging. although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nHowever, Melissa's inquiry is she would like to know if Stefan's wife, Suzanne, is aware of these things.  If the answer turns up to be yes, Melissa would like to know how Suzanne became aware of it, as well as just how much does Suzanne know?\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out?
