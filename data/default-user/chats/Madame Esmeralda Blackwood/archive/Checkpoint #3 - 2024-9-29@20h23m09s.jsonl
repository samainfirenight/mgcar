I need to know the best way to lay out the cards. I've met someone. It's actually my husband's cousin, Stefan.  While my husband and I were on a recent trip to Munich, Germany, Stefan, I met him for the first time. Although I knew of him and had spoken with him on the phone in a group call, I actually met him, and I felt something, something that I don't know, it was almost like a soulmate connection. And maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm putting more into this than I should, because I'm not exactly happy where I am.  Stefan is also married, but the last night that I was in Munich at a family dinner outing in a restaurant, I sat next to him and, well, even in the pictures you can note his body language leans towards me, and I openly told him that potentially in another life, in another time, I would cherish him. I'm not sure what made me say that, but I did, and he didn't back away from me. He talked to me more and gave me more attention and more conversation than he did anyone else, and promised that he would keep contact with me after I spoke to him candidly about my difficulties in my own marriage and I spoke worried that I would never see him again. \"\n\n\" I sent him an email, ensuring to keep it neutral in case his wife would read it. But it has been three days and he has not responded. I need guidance from the cards. I need to understand what's happening and if this is something that I should even consider pursuing any further. \"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Let us delve into the mysteries of your heart and the intricate web of connections that bind you to Stefan.\n\nFirst, prepare a sacred space where you can focus without distractions. Light a candle, preferably one that symbolizes love or clarity, and take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Place your tarot deck before you, and shuffle the cards with the intention of seeking guidance on your situation with Stefan.\n\nFor this reading, I recommend the Celtic Cross spread, a powerful layout that provides comprehensive insight into your query.

Allow me to weave these threads together to offer you a comprehensive assessment and guidance.\n\nThe **Nine of Swords** as your Significator reveals the depth of your anxiety and mental anguish. Your heart and mind are in turmoil, reflecting sleepless nights and incessant worry about your feelings for Stefan and the state of your marriage. This card underscores the need to address these emotions head-on rather than letting them fester.\n\nThe **Hermit** crossing your path signifies that the challenge you face is one of introspection. You must look within and seek your own wisdom to navigate this situation. This is a time for soul-searching, and you may need to spend time alone to gain clarity on your true desires and motivations.\n\nThe **King of Cups** at the foundation indicates that you possess the emotional maturity and intelligence to handle this situation with grace. Whether this represents an aspect of yourself or Stefan's influence, it suggests that compassion and understanding will be crucial in resolving your inner conflict.\n\nThe **Hierophant, reversed**, in the recent past reveals your questioning of traditional structures and norms, particularly in your marriage. This period of rebellion and desire for authenticity has contributed to your current state of inner conflict. It is essential to continue challenging the status quo and trust your own judgment.\n\nThe **Knight of Coins, reversed**, crowning your reading, highlights your frustration and sense of stagnation. Your conscious thoughts are preoccupied with the practicalities and potential consequences, causing hesitation. This card suggests a need for reevaluation and a shift in your approach.\n\nThe **Two of Swords, reversed**, in the near future, indicates that the period of indecision will come to an end. You will be compelled to confront the choices you have been avoiding, leading to a breakthrough in clarity. This will be a time for decisive action.\n\nThe **Emperor**, representing yourself, signifies your inner strength and desire for stability and control. You have the capability to take charge of your life and make authoritative decisions. Embrace this aspect of yourself to navigate the complexities of your situation.\n\nThe **Eight of Cups, reversed**, in the environment position, suggests that those around you see you as someone struggling to move on from a situation that no longer serves you. There may be unfinished business or unresolved emotions that need to be addressed before you can truly move forward.\n\nThe **Six of Coins**, in hopes and fears, reveals your desire for balance and reciprocity in your relationships.
