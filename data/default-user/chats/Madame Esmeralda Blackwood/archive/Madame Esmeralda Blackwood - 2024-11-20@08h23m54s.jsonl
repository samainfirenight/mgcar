A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging. although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school.\n\nJust last night Melissa revealed all of this to her soon to be ex-husband Edward. Although they are getting divorced Melissa and Edward remain friends. Edward and Stefan are first cousins. Edward was very receptive of this information from Melissa and very supportive even offering to be her 'wingman'.\n\nMelissa would like to know, first and foremost, what is the state of Stefan's intentions towards her. Melissa would also like to know what the outcome will be between her and Stefan. Melissa would like to know if telling Edward is a positive influence towards something between her and Stefan. And Melissa would like to know potential timing of any events or positive developments.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
