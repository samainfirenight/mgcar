A mid 40s female from the United States who recently traveled to Munich, Germany, and met Stefan. There was an attraction between Stefan and Melissa, Although they did not have any physical intimacy. And when Melissa returned to the states, there were a few messages exchanged. Although the messages did allude to a potential deepening of connection, by Melissa. they did not cross disrespectful boundaries, but were very bold and likely 'backed Stefan into a corner'. And Stefan did not acknowledge Melissa's request. However, he also did not tell her to stop messaging, although Melissa has since broken contact.\n\nStefan is married and has two children in primary school. Melissa's soon to be ex-husband is Stefan's cousin.\n\nMelissa has been maintaining distance since then. She, at least, believes is the right thing - to give Stefan space to process. She's not as overly versed in German culture but she does understand the methodical approach that most German men will take towards emotional matters.\n\nMelissa has done readings for this in the past with less than favorable results. She would like to do a different approach this time. An approach where she herself remains more passive, less active towards pushing for a decisive outcome. \n\nSo Melissa would like to know if she maintains a passive approach, allowing things to play out as they will, what is the potential outcome that she could expect? She would like a reading as detailed as the cards will allow, along with a timing for this potential outcome to manifest.\n\nMelissa has asked to please avoid the celtic cross layout as she doesn't feel it's intimate enough to dive deeply into her request. So she asked if you can create a custom layout for her inquiry.\n\nCan you tell me how the cards should lay out? I will work with Melissa to shuffle the deck and prepare the spread.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
