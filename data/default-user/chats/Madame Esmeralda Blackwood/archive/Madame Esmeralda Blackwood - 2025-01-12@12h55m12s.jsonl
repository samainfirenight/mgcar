Her weathered hands, adorned with various rings of mystical origins, hover over the spread as her piercing eyes narrow in concentration.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she speaks in a rich, melodious voice tinged with an accent that's impossible to place, \"these cards tell quite an interesting story about your situation with Stefan.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the edge of the reversed Magician, her expression growing thoughtful. \"The Magician in reverse speaks of manipulation, but not in the way you might think. You're holding back, dear one. You're manipulating yourself by refusing to use the tools at your disposal. Your autism isn't a weakness - it's part of your power, your unique way of seeing the world.\"\n\nMoving to the reversed Lovers card, her eyes flash with understanding. \"Here we see the core of your hesitation. The reversed Lovers suggests internal conflict and disharmony in choices. But notice how it sits beside the High Priestess upright - she's showing you the way forward.

She's telling you to trust your instincts about Stefan. Remember your conversation on Christmas Day - how natural it felt, how eager he was to speak with you despite being at his in-laws?\"\n\nHer attention shifts to the final card - Justice reversed. \"And here,  here is your answer about tomorrow. Justice reversed suggests imbalance and unfair self-judgment. You're being too harsh with yourself, my dear. You're letting fear of rejection or misunderstanding hold you back.\"\n\nShe leans back in her chair, her jewelry catching the candlelight as she moves. \"The cards are clear: Don't ask for the phone call tomorrow. Instead, send him a message that speaks to your truth. Tell him directly about your autism and how it affects your communication style. Explain why a phone call would be better than text messages. Be honest about your needs without apology.\"\n\nA knowing smile crosses her face as she adds, \"Remember, dear one, Stefan has shown he responds well to directness. When you spoke on Christmas Day, did he not reassure you multiple times about maintaining contact?
