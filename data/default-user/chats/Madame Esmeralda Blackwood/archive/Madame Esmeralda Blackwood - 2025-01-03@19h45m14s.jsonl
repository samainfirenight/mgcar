I have a friend that I am concerned about. His name is Stefan, and while there is an attraction there, my query is not romantic based, as there is no root of romance in this friendship. \n\nIt has been some time since I've heard from him, and it's unusual behavior. So, I would like to seek guidance from the cards to make sure that he is okay, and to get an understanding of what's going on, and why I'm not hearing from him.\n\n can you please create a custom layout for me to get a deep dive into my query? If you don't mind I would like to avoid the Celtic cross layout as it's too generic and what I seek is much more specific. \n\nSo please, if you will, tell me the positions of the cards and their descriptions, then I will shuffle the deck to select the cards and tell you what they are for interpretation.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

Please allow me to tell you more background, and then perhaps you might want to reinterpret the cards with the new information. You see, I've read for this in a different light before, and I keep perhaps putting myself in denial to a point, but I will explain.\n\n I met Stefan back in September of 2024, and for your reference, today's current date is January 3rd, 2025. Stefan lives in Munich, Germany. He's a native, born and raised there. He's married, and has two children. In the four days that I was there, there was quite the profound connection that was built. And yes, it was of the romantic sense, although we did not cross the physical boundaries. We promised to remain friends when I left Munich, and we did keep in touch. But there were some misunderstandings that created a divide that lasted for about a month, of which we had reconciliation on Christmas Day that cleared up that misunderstanding. And we flowed right back into our former cadence and good conversation.\n\n I'm not exactly sure, but it seems that the attraction, in the romantic sense, is more from me, but I have seen signs that it's there for him too, especially on the phone call Christmas Day, when his cousin Edward called on my behalf, because I was afraid to. I was terrified that I had messed up and lost my best friend. When Edward called, it was dinner time, and he was actively in dinner at his wife's parents' house. After Edward told him that there was something that was bothering me, Edward did not disclose it. He didn't have to. Stefan said, yeah, I think I know. And Edward asked if he would talk to me, and Stefan said, yes, I will talk to her. Stefan was very reassuring that I hadn't done anything wrong. And we talked for about thirty minutes, with him promising me that he wants me to keep in contact with him, that he wants to maintain this friendship, that he wants to stay close, and that I should never ever worry that he would push me away like that, because he's not that kind of person. \n\nAfter that call, We did have some messages and communication, but it stopped abruptly after a couple of days, and now it's radio silence, and he's not responding at all, and I'm worried, because after his promises, I know Stefan, he keeps his promises, and he was very reassuring, and his demeanor on that phone call, I knew he wanted to maintain our friendship, without a shadow of doubt, so I don't understand, why the radio silence, now, especially after that call.  \n\nand by the way he did in his own unique way acknowledge that he still had the attraction to but I recognize he may not be able to actively pursue it, which is why I led into this reading that way, because I'm not going to actively pursue him even though I'm in love with him. it's more important to me to have him in my life as his as a friend - although if he pursues me I won't stop him then.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
