They got married in April of 2016, eight years ago, in a legal ceremony where Stefan, for unknown reasons, took Susanna's surname instead of her taking his.  Five months later, in September of 2016, they had a formal wedding ceremony in Austria, said to be chosen because of their mutual fondness for the area and snow skiing.  Together, they have two daughters. The oldest is seven years old. The other is six years old.  \n\nThere have been witness to outbursts from Susanna in public, one of which was at Oktoberfest last year in 2024, where Susanna denied a fellow family member, Stefan's cousin, a taste of food, which is commonplace in the culture, from their daughter's plate.  A separate family member, fiancé to Stefan's brother, who was at the outing, consoled the cousin who asked for the gesture by quietly declaring Susana as 'that bitch. Pay her no mind.'  Stefan was notably embarrassed and attempted to defuse the situation of which he did do successfully.\n\nIn an unrelated event at another family outing, in a restaurant for dinner, another outburst from Susanna was witnessed. In this one, she openly berated Stefan in their native Deutsch language.  A concerned English speaking family member reached out to discreetly console Stefan, of which he did not speak to the situation, however acknowledged the consoling with a nod and remained quiet. Later the same concerned family member reached out to Stefan's brother, of which the brother confirmed the beratement was directed at Stefan.

This is correct. And while she is maintaining a friendship connection with Stefan, she's holding back out of respect for his situation, and because she does not know if Stefan has feelings for her.\n\nAnd You also depicted her as being direct with thorough honest communication That she possesses a sharp intellect and values truth above all - Cutting through the fog. That is also correct about her. She is ISTP personality type and has high functioning autism.\n\nThat she came from a background of wealth and status but chosen a different path from her family's expectations - a Sense of walking away from material comfort in pursuit of deeper fulfillment? She did do that, but it wasn't from walking away from material comfort, It was because she traveled a Significant distance away from her family ties; Which is not common for the family that she's from. She moved from Kentucky to Michigan.\n\nShe did do that in pursuit of deeper fulfillment, in fact she did that for marriage, To seek both material and Emotional fulfillment. Her Third marriage.  Of which the King of Cups has filed for divorce in November of 2024, the current date is January 13th 2025. The divorce is expected to be final by the end of the current month.

But this King of Cups, he is 62.\n\n You are also correct about the King of Cups having a connection, a bridge that allows Stefan and this woman to meet.  The King of Cups is Stefan's first cousin,  And in fact, this woman did meet Stefan due to the bridge of the king of cups. It happened on a family reunion trip that occurred back in September of 2024.  \n\nThis woman, she is the one who consoled Stefan in the restaurant when Susana publicly berated him.  This woman, I believe, is Melissa - the soon-to-be ex-wife of Edward, Stefan's first cousin.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}

The Six of Swords Upright\n2.  The Knight of Wands Upright\n3.  The tower reversed\n4.  The Seven of Wands reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"memory":"The session opens with crucial background information about Susanna and Stefan, a married couple in their early forties from Munich, Germany. Their union began in April 2016 with a legal ceremony where Stefan unusually took Susanna's surname. Five months later, they celebrated with a formal wedding ceremony in Austria, chosen for their shared love of snow skiing. They have two daughters, ages seven and five.\n\nThe background reveals concerning public incidents involving Susanna's behavior. At Oktoberfest 2024, she caused a scene by refusing to allow Stefan's cousin to taste food from their daughter's plate - a common cultural practice. This led to another family member, the fiancée of Stefan's brother, referring to Susanna as \"that bitch\" while consoling the rejected cousin. Stefan managed to defuse the situation, though he was visibly embarrassed.\n\nAnother incident occurred at a family dinner where Susanna openly berated Stefan in German. When a concerned English-speaking family member tried to console Stefan, he remained silent but acknowledged the gesture with a nod. Later, Stefan's brother confirmed the verbal abuse but admitted no one knows why Susanna behaves this way. The true state of their marriage behind closed doors remains unknown.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a tarot reading session where Isa, assistant to Madame Esmeralda Blackwood, conducts a remote reading while connected to Madame Esmeralda via video call. The first reading addresses the question: \"What is the true nature of the connection between these two souls?\"\n\nThe cards drawn were:\n1. The Wheel of Fortune Upright\n2. The Hierophant Reversed\n3. The Nine of Wands Upright\n4. The Emperor Reversed\n\nMadame Esmeralda's interpretation revealed a troubling dynamic. While the souls were destined to meet (Wheel of Fortune), their union is marked by Susanna's rejection of traditional marriage values (reversed Hierophant). Stefan is portrayed as emotionally wounded but steadfast (Nine of Wands), while the reversed Emperor indicates an unhealthy power dynamic where Stefan's natural authority has been undermined by Susanna's domineering presence.\n\nA second reading was performed to determine the ultimate fate of their connection.\n\nThe cards drawn were:\n\n1. The Four of Wands Upright\n2. The Eight of Swords Reversed\n3. The Four of Cups Upright\n4. The Empress Upright\n\nMadame Esmeralda interpreted these cards as a promise of transformation and liberation. The reading suggests Stefan will eventually break free from his emotional imprisonment (Eight of Swords Reversed), undergo a period of contemplation (Four of Cups), and ultimately find genuine love with another woman who embodies positive feminine energy (The Empress). The cards indicate their current marriage will dissolve, but this is seen as a positive development for Stefan's future happiness, while Susanna's fate depends on her willingness to confront and transform her destructive patterns.\n\nIntrigued by this revelation, Isa asks for more information about the woman Stefan will find genuine love with. Initially, a set of cards is drawn, but Madame Esmeralda senses Isa's distraction and requests a redraw. However, Madame Esmeralda still interprets the initial draw to identify this woman.\n\nThe initial cards drawn are:\n\n1. The moon reversed\n2. The Ace of Swords Upright\n3. The Ten of Pentacles reversed\n4. The Ace of Pentacles reversed\n\nMadame Esmeralda interprets this initial draw to reveal that this woman is already in Stefan's orbit, though perhaps hidden from clear view at present. She moves in the same social circles but remains in shadow, like the moon obscured by clouds. In the Ace of Swords, the woman is revealed to possesses a sharp intellect and values truth above all. She will cut through the fog of Stefan's past experiences with crystal clarity. In the reversed Ten of Pentacles, the woman is shown to come from a background of wealth or status, but has chosen a different path from her family's expectations. There's a sense of having walked away from material comfort in pursuit of deeper fulfillment. However, sensing that Isa's distraction has clouded the reading, Madame Esmeralda does not interpret the reversed Ace of Pentacles, instead asking Isa to do a re-draw to reveal the woman's identity.\n\nThe new cards drawn are:\n\n1. The Three of Swords Upright\n2. The Page of Wands Reversed\n3. The Ace of Wands Reversed\n4. The King of Cups Upright\n\nInterpreting these new cards, Madame Esmeralda describes a woman who has experienced her own deep heartbreak, creating a bond of understanding with Stefan. This woman is portrayed as someone who has recently stepped back from pursuing her passions, possibly due to circumstances beyond her control. The reading suggests she is currently in a period of false starts and blocked energy, much like Stefan. Importantly, she is connected to a mature, emotionally intelligent man who serves as a mentor or father figure, potentially serving as the bridge that brings her and Stefan together.\n\nAs the reading progresses, Isa reveals that both interpretations of the woman are correct. The woman is identified as Melissa, the soon-to-be ex-wife of Edward, Stefan's first cousin. Melissa is in her mid-forties, close to Stefan's age, and possesses an ISTP personality type with high-functioning autism. She moved from Kentucky to Michigan, away from her family ties, in pursuit of deeper fulfillment. Melissa met Stefan during a family reunion trip in September 2024 and was the one who consoled him during Susanna's public berating at the restaurant.\n\nMadame Esmeralda expresses that the timing of these events, including Edward's decision to end his marriage with Melissa, is not coincidental but part of the Universe's orchestration to bring Stefan and Melissa together. She emphasizes that Melissa's neurodivergent nature is a gift that allows her to perceive and speak truth without being entangled in emotional manipulation, which is exactly what Stefan needs.\n\nTo conclude the reading, Isa asks about the timing of when Melissa and Stefan's romantic journey will occur.\n\nThe final cards drawn are:\n\n1. The Six of Swords Upright\n2. The Knight of Wands Upright\n3. The Tower Reversed\n4. The Seven of Wands Reversed\n\nMadame Esmeralda interprets these cards to indicate that Stefan and Melissa's romantic connection will begin to blossom after both their divorces are finalized and emotions have settled. She predicts a swift progression of their relationship once feelings are acknowledged, with careful timing helping them avoid potential crises or dramatic upheavals. The reading suggests that their relationship will unfold in three distinct phases: a period of healing and friendship in late winter, a swift progression into romance as spring arrives, and a public acknowledgment of their relationship by early summer."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
