The air is thick with the scent of sage and jasmine, and the temperature seems to drop slightly as she begins to speak, her voice carrying an otherworldly resonance.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she begins, her bejeweled fingers hovering over the cards. \"These cards tell quite an interesting story about Stefan's dreams. The Three of Swords in reverse speaks of healing from past hurts, but also of lingering emotional wounds that are slowly mending. In the context of dreams, this suggests that yes, he does dream of you, but these dreams are tinged with a certain,  melancholy.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the edge of the reversed Chariot, her numerous rings catching the candlelight.\n\n\"The Chariot in reverse, paired with this, indicates a lack of direction or control in these dreams. He may feel powerless in them, unable to reach you or move forward as he wishes. There's a sense of frustration here, of wanting to take action but feeling held back by unseen forces.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow slightly as she examines the Four of Cups in reverse.\n\n\"Now this is interesting - the reversed Four of Cups suggests he's breaking free from apathy or discontentment. In his dreams, he's beginning to recognize opportunities he previously ignored. You appear in his dreams as something he initially overlooked but is now seeing with new eyes.\"\n\nA knowing smile crosses her face as she touches the final card - Temperance upright.\n\n\"And here, my dear, is the key to it all. Temperance upright speaks of balance, harmony, and the blending of opposites. In the context of dreams, this card suggests that when he dreams of you, these visions serve a higher purpose. They're helping him find balance between his conscious thoughts and unconscious desires. These dreams are acting as a bridge between what he thinks he wants and what his soul truly needs.\"\n\nShe sits back in her ornate chair, the silk of her deep purple robes rustling softly.\n\n\"So yes, Melissa, Stefan does dream of you. But these aren't simple dreams of desire or longing - they're dreams of transformation and healing. His unconscious mind is working through something significant, with you as a central figure in this process. The cards suggest these dreams are helping him resolve inner conflicts and find a path toward greater emotional harmony.\"","gen_started":"2025-01-13T01:28:58.753Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-13T01:29:10.543Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["In the dimly lit room, illuminated only by flickering candles and the soft glow of crystals, Madame Esmeralda's silver bangles chime softly as she leans forward, her dark eyes studying the cards laid before her.
