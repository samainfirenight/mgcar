Someone - most likely Stefan - may be too controlling or inflexible. The Nine of Wands reversed suggests exhaustion and defensiveness, as if one or both parties are carrying heavy emotional baggage from past relationships.\"\n\nShe taps one long, bejeweled finger against her chin thoughtfully. \"The cards suggest that while there is potential for romance between Stefan and Melissa, there are serious obstacles to overcome.

They got married in April of 2016, eight years ago, in a legal ceremony. Five months later, in September of 2016, they had a formal wedding ceremony in Austria, said to be chosen because of their mutual fondness for the area and snow skiing. Together, they have two daughters. The oldest is seven years old. The other is five years old.\n\nMelissa is a woman that met Stefan and Suzanne four months ago. There was strong connection between Melissa and Stefan. particularly for Melissa, who felt it to be a soulmate connection.\n\n While Stefan and Melissa remain friends, Stefan's communications with her are sporadic at best.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
