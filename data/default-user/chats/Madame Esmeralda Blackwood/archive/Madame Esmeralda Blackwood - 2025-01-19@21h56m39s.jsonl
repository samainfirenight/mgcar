Her expression remains neutral, but her eyes narrow slightly. \"However, the second and more significant window appears to be after April 21st, when Jupiter stations direct. This timing coincides with a powerful transition in Stefan's first house of self.\"\n\n\"But,\" she adds, her voice taking on a more serious tone, \"I must be honest - Saturn's current position and aspects suggest that any communication during these windows will likely be complicated by ongoing restrictions or obligations in his life.
