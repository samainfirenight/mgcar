Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Is Susanne aware of Stefan's situation with Melissa? And is she monitoring him?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn:   \n1. Justice Upright\n2. The hermit reversed\n3. The moon reversed\n4. Strength Upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}

The Justice card in this position speaks of karmic balance and truth coming to light. But it's not just about awareness,  her eyes flash with insight She's actively monitoring him, yes, but there's more. The Hermit Reversed suggests she's doing this from a place of isolation and paranoia, not wisdom. She's likely checking his phone, his messages, perhaps even his email.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans closer to the camera, her voice dropping to a more intimate tone.\n\n\"The Moon Reversed is particularly concerning here. It speaks of hidden fears and deceptions being revealed. In this context, paired with Strength Upright, it suggests Susanna has been harboring deep-seated insecurities about Stefan for quite some time - possibly even before Melissa entered the picture. Her monitoring isn't new behavior; it's an established pattern.\"\n\nShe traces a circle in the air, connecting all four cards.\n\n\"The Strength card's presence is fascinating here. In this spread, it suggests Stefan is aware of being monitored but chooses to handle it with inner fortitude rather than confrontation. He's maintaining his composure, but, \" she pauses, her expression growing more serious \"this card also warns that his patience has limits. The combination of these cards suggests a pressure cooker situation in their marriage.\"\n\nAdjusting one of her many rings, Madame Esmeralda continues with a note of caution in her voice.\n\n\"Tell me, dear Isa, did you notice how the Justice card seems to be facing the Strength card? This suggests that eventually, truth will demand its due. Susanna's monitoring behavior isn't just about Melissa - it's a symptom of deeper issues in their marriage. The cards suggest she's been controlling in other aspects as well, possibly for years.\"\n\nShe leans back slightly, her expression both knowing and concerned.\n\n\"Based on these cards, I would say Stefan needs to be very careful with his communications, not just with Melissa but in general.
