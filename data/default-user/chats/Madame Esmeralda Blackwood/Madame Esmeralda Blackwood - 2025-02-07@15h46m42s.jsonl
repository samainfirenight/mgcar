The Venus-Neptune conjunction in his house suggests he was operating on a higher frequency of perception. When he spoke of your character's beauty, he was accessing a spiritual truth that transcends the physical.\n\nTraces the aspect patterns with her finger\n\nThe Stellium configuration involving Venus, Neptune, and the North Node in your 9th house indicates this wasn't just flattery or casual observation. This man has the rare gift of seeing past the illusory veil of physical appearance to perceive the luminous quality of one's inner being.\n\nLooks up with piercing intensity\n\nYour dismissiveness, my dear, stems from the Moon square Saturn aspect. You've built walls around your self-worth, particularly during those three difficult years. But his perception wasn't clouded by your temporary physical state or your own self-judgment.\n\nTaps the Venus-Pluto sextile significantly\n\nThis aspect tells me he saw you with almost uncomfortable clarity - the kind that strips away pretense and sees straight to essence. Your character's beauty literally could not be hidden from him, regardless of your physical state or self-perception at the time."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 7, 2025 4:02pm","gen_started":"2025-02-07T21:02:52.404Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T21:02:59.930Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
