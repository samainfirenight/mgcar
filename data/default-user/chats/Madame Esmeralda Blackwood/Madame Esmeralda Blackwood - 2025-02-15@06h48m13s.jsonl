{"name":"Melissa Gale","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"February 15, 2025 6:48am","mes":" I had a very strange dream that, for whatever reason, my perfectly maintained and mint-conditioned Mustang, when I had it running, as I typically do throughout the winter season and then in the spring, well, this would have been the spring, and I was letting it run to recirculate oils and whatnots, anyway, it got hot, tremendously overheated, for whatever reason the car had a turbo on it, which is not something that actually exists on a car, plus it's a V8 engine. Anyway, it was overheated, and I was helping my now ex-husband clean up items in the yard in preparation for something, but I don't know what that something was, my daughter was helping too, and there was a lot of garbage, and one of my husband's, ex-husband, close friends, his name is Brian Kelly, still haven't figured out why he was in the dream, but he was there, and his wife Kim, and Brian was wanting to look at my car which is how we discovered that it was getting overheated because I saw water dripping and smelled the antifreeze and he was like, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh, and initially there was something rattling in the car and I told him, oh yeah, that's right, because the exhaust had a bracket to come loose and I needed to tighten it back up and that's when he said, no, no, there's something else and then we discovered that the car was getting hot so we shut it off and moved it down to the road and then got some air going through it and I used the momentum of the gradual slope on the road to drive the car and get air in it without running the engine which is not something I would typically do but for whatever reason this is what I was doing in the dream and then after a period of time started the car up and it had cooled down enough to be driven so Brian gets into the car and then suddenly it has two steering wheels I'm not sure what that was about but I was in the passenger seat and Brian was in the driver's seat but I was the one driving . and Edward and Brian's wife Kim stayed behind and continued trying to pick up things and clean up the yard even though Brian and Kim were getting ready to leave but because Brian got into the car with me they continued to work. Anyway for whatever reason it was like I just knew that the reason me and Brian were sneaking off is just like that because we were sneaking off but I've never had any kind of feelings or desires for Brian so this didn't make any sense either but my daughter Kayla also gets into the back seat of the car . and eventually because the car was doing good again I asked Brian if he wanted to drive it and he said yeah so it was like I flipped some kind of a proverbial switch because there is no switch like this in that car it made no sense but I flipped the controls to where he could drive and so we drove around and it ended up being that we were on Kentucky back roads at this time which is back in my home state where I haven't lived for 13 years and then when we got to a place and then when we got to a place that he was okay to not drive anymore and just wanted to go back he gave the controls to me and for some reason I was really happy oh I was really happy because we tested the turbo and everything worked flawlessly like it was supposed to and the car immediately responded like it should have and I gave Brian a hug and a kiss on his cheek although inside of me I knew that I wanted to do more and he also knew that I wanted to do more and then he became very flirty and we talked about his age and I was very surprised because I expected Brian to be much older than Edward than what he was because Edward is 64 and Brian is 68 . And Brian was like, no, we're the same age, you know, we went to college together. And I was like, very shocked, like I just thought you were so much older than him.  and so we take the car back even though Brian was holding me in his arms and I was supposed to be driving and Kayla was very surprised but we go back to where Edward and Kim were cleaning up and acting like nothing was going on even though nothing really did go on  and we get the car parked properly and start helping everybody to finish the cleanup. And that's when I woke up is when we were helping to finish the cleanup. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

Dreams are windows into our subconscious, revealing hidden desires, fears, and unresolved issues. Let us delve into the symbolism and meaning behind your nocturnal vision.\n\nFirst, let's consider the central symbol: your cherished Mustang. In dreams, vehicles often represent our journey through life or a particular phase of it. Your Mustang, being a powerful and classic car, might symbolize your sense of personal power, freedom, and perhaps a connection to your past or your roots, given its association with American culture.\n\nThe fact that the car was overheating is significant. This could represent a buildup of emotional or psychological pressure in your waking life. You mentioned that you maintain the car well, which suggests you take good care of yourself and your responsibilities. However, the unexpected overheating might indicate that despite your best efforts, you're feeling overwhelmed or that something in your life is causing unexpected stress.\n\nThe presence of a turbo that doesn't actually exist on your car is intriguing. Turbos boost performance, so this could symbolize a desire for increased power or efficiency in some area of your life. Perhaps you're feeling a need to accelerate your progress or amplify your capabilities in some way.\n\nNow, let's look at the characters in your dream. Your ex-husband and daughter being present while cleaning up the yard suggests a theme of \"tidying up\" past relationships or lingering issues. The yard, being an external space, might represent how you present yourself to the world or deal with external matters.\n\nBrian Kelly and his wife Kim entering the dream is particularly interesting. Dreams often use familiar faces to represent aspects of ourselves or to highlight certain qualities. The fact that Brian was interested in your car and helped diagnose the problem might suggest that you value his opinion or see him as someone who can offer insight into your personal issues.\n\nThe moment when you and Brian \"sneak off\" in the car is laden with symbolism. Despite never having had feelings for him in waking life, in the dream, there's a sense of excitement and forbidden attraction. This could represent a desire for excitement or novelty in your life, or perhaps an unexplored aspect of your personality that you associate with qualities Brian possesses.\n\nThe two steering wheels in the car are a powerful symbol. This could represent a feeling of shared control or perhaps a conflict between your conscious desires and your subconscious needs. The fact that you were driving from the passenger seat might indicate that you feel you're not fully in control of a situation in your life, or that you're influencing things from behind the scenes.\n\nYour happiness when the car, especially the turbo, worked flawlessly after the issues could symbolize a resolution of some problem in your waking life, or a hope that current difficulties will be overcome.\n\nThe affectionate moment with Brian, and your internal acknowledgment of wanting more, might not be about Brian specifically. Instead, it could represent a general desire for intimacy, excitement, or a new connection in your life. The surprise about his age could symbolize a realization that opportunities or connections you thought were out of reach might actually be more accessible than you believed.\n\nReturning to help with the cleanup at the end of the dream brings us full circle. It suggests a return to responsibilities and perhaps a guilt or concern about indulging in the \"sneaking off\" fantasy.\n\nOverall, Melissa, your dream seems to be exploring themes of personal power, hidden desires, the need for excitement or change, and perhaps some unresolved feelings about past relationships or missed opportunities. The car troubles and subsequent resolution might indicate that you're working through some personal issues and feeling optimistic about overcoming them.\n\nRemember, dreams are highly personal, and only you can truly know what resonates as true for you. I encourage you to reflect on these symbols and see which interpretations feel right to you. Is there an area of your life where you feel things are \"overheating\"? Are you longing for more excitement or power in your life? Are there unresolved feelings about past relationships that might need addressing?\n\nConsider journaling about these themes or meditating on the imagery from your dream. You might find that it offers valuable insights into your current state of mind and emotional needs.","gen_started":"2025-02-15T11:51:27.787Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-15T11:51:49.854Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Ah, my dear Melissa, what a fascinating dream you've shared with me.
