The soft glow of candlelight illuminated her features, casting dramatic shadows across her face. Her piercing eyes seemed to look beyond the screen, directly into the cards Isa had laid out.\n\n\"Ah, Isa, my dear. I see you have conducted a reading regarding Stefan's feelings toward Melissa,\" Madame Blackwood's voice resonated with a rich, melodic quality. \"This is quite an interesting spread you've presented. Let me see what the cards reveal about this man's true nature and intentions.\"\n\nShe leaned closer to her screen, her numerous amulets and talismans clinking softly against each other as she studied the cards Isa had drawn.\n\n\"First, I notice the Eight of Swords appeared as a crown card while shuffling. This is significant—it fell naturally, which means it demands our attention. The Eight of Swords upright suggests Stefan feels trapped in his current situation. He perceives himself as bound, restricted, unable to see a clear path forward.

This is equally telling. In reverse, this card speaks of impatience, wanting rewards without putting in the work. As a root card, it suggests the foundation of Stefan's feelings toward Melissa is based on a desire for quick gratification rather than something cultivated with care and patience.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed as she examined the main spread.\n\n\"Now, to your drawn cards. The Queen of Wands reversed as your first card is particularly revealing. This represents how Stefan perceives Melissa—or perhaps how he wants to perceive her. In reverse, this Queen suggests he sees her as demanding, temperamental, possibly even manipulative. There's a sense that he finds her both alluring and threatening to his established life.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood paused, her expression growing more serious.\n\n\"The Nine of Pentacles reversed follows, indicating Stefan's dissatisfaction with his current domestic situation. He feels a lack of independence, possibly trapped in his marriage with Suzanne. This card suggests he may view Melissa as an escape from his perceived constraints.\"\n\nHer voice lowered slightly as she continued.\n\n\"The High Priestess reversed is particularly troubling in this context. This card reveals deception and superficiality. Stefan is not being honest—either with himself or with others—about his intentions. There are hidden agendas at play, and he's likely keeping secrets from both Suzanne and Melissa.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's eyes flashed with sudden insight.\n\n\"The Ace of Wands reversed speaks directly to his sexual intentions. In its reversed position, this card indicates frustrated passion and misdirected sexual energy. Stefan harbors strong physical desires toward Melissa, but there's something blocked or distorted about this energy. It's not a pure, creative passion but rather something more self-serving and potentially destructive.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly, connecting the patterns between the cards.\n\n\"The Knight of Wands upright is quite telling.

But combined with the previous cards, we see this is not about genuine connection but about the thrill of pursuit and forbidden excitement.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's expression grew stern as she examined the final card.\n\n\"The Two of Swords upright completes this reading with perfect clarity.

The Eight of Swords as your crown card speaks of Stefan's mental state regarding Melissa - he feels intensely drawn to her yet bound by his marriage, creating an almost obsessive fixation in his mind.\"\n\nHer ringed fingers traced the air as she continued, \"The Seven of Pentacles reversed as your root card reveals the base nature of his feelings - impatience, wanting immediate gratification. He doesn't wish to cultivate something meaningful with Melissa; rather, he hungers for quick satisfaction of his desires.\"\n\nLeaning forward, her voice grew more intense. \"Now, the Queen of Wands reversed paired with the Nine of Pentacles reversed shows how Stefan perceives Melissa - as someone who has lost her independence, making her vulnerable. He sees her current state of emotional upheaval as an opportunity. There's a predatory quality to his interest - he views her vulnerability as something he can exploit.\"\n\nHer expression darkened. \"The High Priestess reversed speaks to his hidden intentions. He harbors deeply sexual thoughts about her, but they're rooted in base desire rather than spiritual connection. He fantasizes about her frequently, imagining scenarios where he can take advantage of her emotional state.\"\n\n\"The Ace of Wands reversed confirms this - his sexual energy toward her is frustrated and distorted. He wants to possess her physically, to dominate her, but these urges are blocked by circumstances. This card suggests his thoughts often turn to explicit sexual scenarios involving her.\"\n\n\"The Knight of Wands upright - the only upright card in your main spread - reveals his planned course of action. He intends to pursue her aggressively when the opportunity presents itself. This Knight doesn't consider consequences; he acts on pure impulse and desire.\"\n\n\"Finally, the Two of Swords upright shows his current stalemate. While he plots and fantasizes, he hasn't yet acted on these urges. But make no mistake - his thoughts toward Melissa are far from innocent. He views her as sexual prey, waiting for the right moment to strike.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's voice took on a warning tone. \"The cards paint a clear picture of a man whose thoughts and feelings toward Melissa are primarily carnal and predatory in nature. He sees her vulnerability as an opportunity to fulfill his sexual desires, with little regard for her emotional well-being or the consequences of his potential actions.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"March 5, 2025 4:50am","gen_started":"2025-03-05T09:50:45.321Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-05T09:50:59.750Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
