You've recently gained understanding about something that was unclear before - specifically about Stefan's subtle message through that movie recommendation. This card confirms your realization was accurate.\n\nThe Nine of Swords reversed suggests relief from anxiety and worry. You've been carrying heavy concerns about your connection with Stefan, but this card indicates those fears are beginning to lift as understanding grows between you.\n\nAnd The World,  oh my dear, this is quite significant as your final card. The World represents completion, wholeness, and things coming full circle. In this context, it suggests your message to Stefan has created a moment of perfect understanding between you both.\n\nHowever,  her eyes narrow thoughtfully regarding your specific question about a response within 24 hours - while these cards show extremely positive energy around your connection and validate your understanding of his feelings, they also suggest patience may be needed.
