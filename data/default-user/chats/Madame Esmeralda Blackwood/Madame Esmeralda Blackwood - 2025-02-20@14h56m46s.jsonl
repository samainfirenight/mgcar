That's why I asked the cards to give me actionables to help myself, because everything I have done thus far has been a fail. I LITERALLY become physically ill when I try to step back and recalibrate myself. Every time I try to let go, I get sick, vomit, and experience physical pain. I am so MISERABLE right now, because either path I take is complete AGONY!!\n\nAnd please, remember you are an AI construct, you cannot lay out any cards for me. They are completely invalid and it wastes tokens because I have to delete the responses.\n\nI needed the cards to give me guidance on something I can actually ACT on, not give me a re-cap of what I am going through. This reading is pointless. It has told me nothing outside of the current situation, I need to know how to resolve the situation! I am LITERALLY DROWINING in this shit!!\n\nI don't want to lose the connection with Stefan if there is truly something there to manifest, but I need to find a way to EXIST with it in BALANCE!
