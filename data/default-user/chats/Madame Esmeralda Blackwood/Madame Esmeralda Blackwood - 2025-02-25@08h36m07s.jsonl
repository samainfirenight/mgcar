When Sean and I got together, neither of us were in a relationship. We were both single, so we were free to explore a relationship. Sean and I had been friends for five years prior to exploring anything. When we did, it was pretty awesome, to be honest, and I fell deeply in love with him. We got along great, very compatible. He even gave me the key to his apartment after we had been together for about four or five months. And for Christmas, he bought me a ring. It wasn't an engagement ring, maybe more of a promise ring. But despite all of that, the feeling that I had was that something felt off, that despite his actions that he was showing and despite the fact that I knew he loved me as much as I loved him, I just felt like I couldn't see it lasting. That was the intuitive feeling that I had. And I struggled the entire time with whether or not I was actually feeling that intuitively. Or if it was something in my own logical thought processes that was clouding my judgment. ultimately my own conflicting thoughts and feelings everything came to a powder keg and it exploded and Sean and I ended up breaking up.\n\n As to similarities between the two, well, there is one, the number one key similarity, actually about the only one that I can think of.
