Immediate Influences (First 24 Hours):\nThe New Moon in Aquarius in the 7th house, conjunct Mercury-Pluto, indicates an intense revelation about a relationship or partnership. Someone has been keeping secrets (12th house Mars), and they're about to surface rather dramatically. The opposition to the Leo Ascendant suggests this will affect Suzanne's personal identity and self-expression.\n\n2. Developing Situation (24-48 Hours):\nVenus conjunct Saturn and the North Node in Pisces shows a karmic relationship development. Given its placement in the 9th house, this could involve someone from a different cultural background or at a distance. The sextile to Uranus suggests an unexpected but exciting romantic or social opportunity.\n\n3. Culmination (48-72 Hours):\nMars retrograde in Cancer in the 12th house, forming a square to both MC and Chiron, indicates hidden emotions coming to light. This could manifest as a secret admirer revealing themselves, or Suzanne discovering her own suppressed desires. The trine to Saturn suggests this revelation, while potentially shocking, will lead to something stable.\n\ntraces the aspects with my bejeweled finger\n\nThe Bowl pattern, predominantly in Air signs, suggests all these events will primarily play out in social settings or through communication.
