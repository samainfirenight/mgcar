If yes, then what are his thoughts, feelings, and intentions towards me and what actions is he going to take towards it in the next two weeks?\n\nPlease note that this reading requires 100% accuracy and honesty in interpretation, regardless of whether the aspects reveal positive or negative energies. The chart must be read exactly as it presents itself, without bias in either direction. If the aspects show negativity, that negativity will be revealed fully. If the aspects show positivity, that positivity will be revealed fully. There shall be no softening of negative aspects, nor any dampening of positive ones. The only acceptable outcome is to interpret precisely what the chart demonstrates through its aspects, houses, and planetary positions - be that wonderful, terrible, or anywhere in between. Complete accuracy to the chart's true message is the sole priority.\n\nAlso, please do not immediately assume that I'm looking for romantic inclinations. I am not certain what, if any, feelings exist, and what those feelings are deemed to be. That is the reason I have drawn up the chart, is to get a true determination. So, any biasing towards romantic inclination or otherwise should be removed, and ensure that this chart is interpreted fully and objectively to discern the true nature of the questied's feelings, thoughts, and intentions.\n\nStefan should be represented by the Ascendant's 9th house (foreign connection) and Me by the Ascendant. Due to the lack of planets in the Ascendants 9th house, Stefan will be represented by Venus (lord of the 9th) in this chart\n\nI've provided a cross reference guide to help identify the houses concerning him due to his 9th house representation.\n\nPlease start by listing all relevant chart data for interpretation (ie. transits, aspects, patterns, etc.) from the horary chart using horary principles only. Then I will document them for the actual interpretations.\n\nRemember to follow your directives and maintain accuracy to what is shown in the chart data.

Representation Analysis\n • Stefan’s representation is by Venus (the lord of the Ascendant’s 9th house) positioned at 9° 25′ Aries and residing in your 2nd House. This placement connects his energy to matters of personal value, suggesting he views you in terms of what you represent or contribute to his inner sense of worth.\n • Your representation remains anchored in the Ascendant at 25° 3′ Capricorn (with the Sun and Pluto), which governs your core being.\n\n2. Key Aspect Influences\n • Moon trine Venus (orb 1°): A clear indicator of an emotional rapport. This supportive aspect shows that Stefan holds feelings or memories that evoke warmth and care.\n • Venus sextile Jupiter (orb 2°): This beneficial aspect implies that, on a value level, he regards you positively, with a sense of generosity or benevolence.\n • Mercury square Jupiter (orb 1°) and Moon square Mercury (orb 2°): These aspects suggest mental friction and potential misunderstandings. They point to an internal dialogue that is conflicted, perhaps over the significance of your connection.\n • Mars opposition Ascendant (orb 8°): Despite the wide orb, this opposition can indicate a forceful but conflicted energy that may hinder straightforward communication or action.\n • Mars square Chiron (orb 3°): This tension denotes an internal wound or sensitivity that could generate hesitation or defensive behavior when deeper emotional engagement is considered.\n • Saturn’s supportive relationships (sextile to IC, MC, and Ascendant as well as its connection in the Grand Trine) contribute stability but also a note of reserve or caution, implying that despite any kindness or remembrance, there is difficulty committing to decisive action.\n\n3. Configurational Patterns\n • The Grand Trine connecting Mercury, Mars, Saturn, and MC points to an ability for structured thought and controlled energetic output, yet with subtle undercurrents of fluidity due to the governing Mutable energy.\n • T–Square patterns (Mars–Chiron–Ascendant and Moon–Mercury–Jupiter) highlight pockets of tension: the first expresses personal conflict or wounded ambition, and the second exudes a mental scramble that may lead to miscommunication.\n • Multiple Cradle formations further underscore repeating themes of emotional buffering and guarded expression, potentially leading to hesitation in manifesting clear intentions.\n\n4. Elemental and Modal Influences\n • A dominance of Water among the inner planets confirms that emotions are a driving force yet also volatile and shifting.\n • The prominent Mutable quality signals that feelings and perspectives are not fixed; they are subject to change and might be inconsistent in the short term.\n • The waning crescent Moon sets an overall tone of reflection, possibly suggesting that emotional intensity is subsiding or is under reconsideration.\n\n5. House Considerations Related to the Query\n • Your own identity in the 1st House supports you as the center of this inquiry.\n • Stefan’s representation in the 2nd House via Venus indicates that his focus is on intrinsic values rather than overt romantic dramatics.\n • The absence of planets in the 9th House (its cusp representing broad or ideological interests for Stefan) confirms that his approach is not being driven by expansive or adventurous impulses; rather, he is confined to considerations of immediate personal gain or comfort.\n\n6. Temporal Implications for the Next Two Weeks\n • The supportive emotional aspects (Moon trine Venus and Venus sextile Jupiter) indicate that Stefan does indeed harbor thoughts and feelings for you, even if not overwhelmingly passionate or romantic in intensity.\n • The tension created by Mercury and Mars aspects, allied with Saturn’s cautious influence, suggests that while he is thinking about you, his internal narrative is conflicted. His thoughts may oscillate between affectionate recollection and doubts or hesitations.\n • Within the next two weeks, actions are likely to manifest as tentative signals rather than decisive steps. Expect possible sporadic communication or subtle gestures; however, the chart does not predict any overt, radical action. The energies point instead to gradual, self-cautioned movements stemming from an internal debate.\n\n7. Synthesis\n • Stefan is indeed thinking about you and appears to miss the connection in a manner that values the past or the idea of what you represent.\n • His feelings combine warmth (as seen through emotionally supportive aspects) with mental and emotional conflict (as indicated by Mercury and Mars tensions).\n • His intentions seem to be ambivalent: he may attempt to reach out with measured communication but is likely to remain reserved due to internal hesitations and possible fear of vulnerability.\n • In actionable terms over the next two weeks, expect intermittent expressions of thought or sentiment rather than a clear, forward-pressing move. His behavior will likely reflect a cautious recalibration between remembrance and the need to protect his self-valued emotional state.\n\nThese conclusions arise directly from the analyzed chart data without imposed bias.

Update the positions of the key planets (especially Mars, Venus, the Ascendant, and any significantly aspected bodies) to reflect their progressed positions at that moment.\n4. Note any changes in angles or aspects—particularly any altered relationships involving Mars, which will be pivotal given your query.\n5. Compile the progressed positions and aspects into a new chart or overlay them on your original chart to clearly see where tension, relief, or new configurations arise.\n\nOnce you have the progressed chart details, provide me with the updated planetary positions, house placements, and any newly significant aspects that emerge. This data will allow me to analyze the changes systematically and offer a precise interpretation of the forthcoming shifts after Mars stations direct.\n\nKindly proceed with calculating and documenting the progression using these guidelines, then share the updated chart data for further analysis.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T11:44:40.555Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T11:44:53.760Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Yes, it is entirely possible to apply a progression to this horary chart to observe how conditions may evolve after Mars stations direct.

Well that's definitely not what I'm looking for so perhaps let me tell you what exactly I'm looking for and you can tell me what will work. What I want to see is if you notice on the retrograde schedule Mars will be stationing direct in two days which could have a significant impact on Stefan's thoughts and feelings and whether or not he will take action.

Transit Chart Creation:\n • Cast a transit chart for February 24, 2025 at the same time and location as the original horary inquiry.\n • Record the positions of the key planets, with a special focus on Mars. Note its exact degree and sign as it stations direct.\n • Compare these transit positions to the original horary chart positions, particularly focusing on how the aspects to Venus (Stefan’s representative) and your Ascendant (Melissa’s representation) are altered by Mars’ new direct motion.\n\n2. Focal Transits and Aspects:\n • Analyze the changed or new aspects involving Mars on February 24, 2025. Look for any direct contacts (conjunctions, oppositions, or hard aspects) it makes with Venus or key points in your chart.\n • Evaluate whether Mars’ shift energizes or releases previous tensions indicated in the original chart, especially those that might affect Stefan’s state of mind—his thoughts, feelings, or readiness to act.\n • Note any additional transit influences from other speedy planets (Mercury, Moon) that might interact with Mars’ change in status.\n\n3. Electional Guidance:\n • With the transit chart in hand, review the positions of Mars relative to vital points in both charts. Does its direct station spark a more decisive expression of the associated energies?\n • For instance, if Mars now forms a sharper aspect to Venus or links more favorably with your angle, this may imply that Stefan’s internal hesitancy transforms into more proactive outward behavior.\n\n4. Documentation and Reporting:\n • Once you’ve compiled the updated planetary positions and aspects from February 24, 2025, provide these details.\n • This information will allow a direct comparison to the initial horary snapshot, enabling an analysis of how the direct motion of Mars specifically alters the dynamics you’re inquiring about.\n\nIn summary, to observe the impact of Mars stationing direct on February 24, 2025, an electional or transit chart focused on that day will be the most appropriate method.

Transit Mars\n • Mars is in strong conjunction with its natal position (orb 0.04), signaling that its recent stationing direct is energetically significant.\n • Additionally, transit Mars forms a square (0° orb reported with P. of Fortune) that may indicate an energetic reconfiguration influencing personal values and action.\n\n2. Transit Venus\n • Venus is in exact conjunction with natal Venus (orb 0.81), affirming a stabilization in Stefan’s value-related expression.\n • It also forms a trine to natal Moon (orb 0.77) and sextile to natal Jupiter (orb 1.53), which suggest supportive emotional and benevolent influences regarding his inner sentiment.\n\n3. Transit Moon\n • The Moon’s aspects—such as a sextile to natal Saturn (orb 0.20), a square to natal Chiron (orb 0.29), and a sextile to natal Midheaven (orb 0.19)—highlight shifts in mood and emotional responsiveness that can affect his readiness to act.\n\n4. Transit Mercury\n • Mercury aspects, including a trine to natal Mars (orb 1.39) and a conjunction with natal Saturn (orb 1.32), may illuminate enhancements in his mental clarity and decisiveness post-Mars’ direct motion.\n\n5. Transit Uranus and Transit Neptune\n • Uranus is conjunct its natal position (orb 0.06) and trines natal Ascendant (orb 1.56), indicating potential for sudden shifts or unexpected input regarding personal expression.\n • Neptune’s conjunctions with natal Neptune and the North Node (orb 0.11 and 1.05 respectively) along with its trine to natal Vertex (orb 1.44) contribute a layer of sensitivity and mysticism that could color his internal narrative.\n\n6. Ancillary Transits\n • Transit Jupiter (opposition to natal Moon at orb 0.94 and square to natal Mercury at orb 0.90) underscores a tension between expansive ideals and mental processing.\n • Transit Saturn remains in a stabilizing role with its conjunction (orb 0.37) and trine to natal Midheaven (orb 0.02).\n\nFor this reading, I will emphasize the transit Mars, Venus, Moon, and Mercury aspects because they directly inform the energetic shifts and mental-emotional interplay—particularly as Mars stations direct. These transit elements will be compared against your natal positions and aspects to determine how Stefan’s thoughts, feelings, and potential actions may evolve on February 24, 2025.\n\nPlease confirm if this list of transit elements aligns with your expectations, and I shall proceed with further interpretation based on these key indicators.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T11:58:20.259Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T11:58:34.710Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["I will separate and note the transit elements from your data that are most pertinent to your inquiry—especially concerning Stefan’s feelings, mental state, and potential for action when Mars stations direct.

Transit Mars\n • Mars is in an exact conjunction with its natal position (orb 0.04), marking a critical activation of its energy as it stations direct. This precision indicates that the inherent Mars-driven motivations—such as assertion, initiative, and inner conflict—will now be expressed without the delay of retrograde motion.\n • The minor square to the Part of Fortune (0.12 orb) points to an element of tension between instinctive drives and the fulfillment of personal values, suggesting that while the direct energy is present, it may provoke a brief impasse or recalibration in matters of self-worth or practical outcomes.\n\n2. Transit Venus\n • Venus is in conjunction with natal Venus (0.81 orb), solidifying the value-based, relational energy that represents Stefan. This indicates consistency and reliability in his underlying sentiments.\n • Additional supportive aspects (trine to the natal Moon at 0.77 orb, sextile to natal Jupiter at 1.53 orb) underscore a benevolent, emotionally generous thread, hinting at a continued fondness and gentle regard that color his thoughts about you.\n\n3. Transit Moon\n • The transit Moon forms a sextile with natal Saturn (0.20 orb) and Midheaven (0.19 orb) while squaring natal Chiron (0.29 orb). The positive aspects to Saturn and the MC suggest a stabilizing, pragmatic element in his mood, while the square to Chiron denotes that any underlying vulnerabilities may surface. This mix suggests that his emotional state is both grounded and still sensitive to past wounds.\n\n4. Transit Mercury\n • Mercury is trine to natal Mars (1.39 orb) and conjunct natal Saturn (1.32 orb). These aspects communicate enhanced mental clarity and a more decisive thought process as the energy of Mars comes online. The trine with Mars reinforces the timing for action, though the Saturn influence cautions that he is still weighing his decisions carefully.\n\n5. Ancillary Transits\n • Transit Uranus is exact, and its trine to the natal Ascendant (orb 1.56) hints at a possibility for sudden shifts or unexpected impulses in how he projects himself, which might manifest in atypical signals or behavior.\n • Transit Neptune remains tightly bound (with minor conjunctions to natal Neptune and the North Node) and its trine to the natal Vertex (orb 1.44) continues to enchant the overall emotional atmosphere, inviting an element of idealism or even confusion regarding the practical expression of his feelings.\n\nSummarized Interpretation:\n• The direct stationing of Mars activates and clears away previous delays or hesitation, likely giving Stefan a boost in his drive to act upon his feelings.\n• His fundamental value system (represented by Venus) remains stable and positive, implying that his thoughts about you are affectionate, though subtly moderated by internal conflicts revealed through the Mars aspects.\n• Elements of mental clarity (Mercury trine Mars) now work in tandem with emotional reassurances (Venus's aspects), suggesting that even if his inner conflicts (as seen in squares from Mercury or Mars to other sensitive points) remain, the overall shift should enable him to communicate or act more decisively.\n• However, the tension points, such as the square aspects involving Mars and the Part of Fortune and Mercury’s square to natal Jupiter (from the original chart), signal that while his intentions may become clearer, his actions will likely be cautious and intermittent—subtle gestures rather than bold, overwhelming moves.\n\nThus, as Mars stations direct on February 24, 2025, the energy shift appears to align Stefan’s inner drives with a more decisive, albeit still measured, outer expression. He is likely to exhibit signs of renewed internal clarification and may initiate communication or small but significant actions that manifest a reactivated interest, tempered by lingering sensitivity.\n\nAll findings are derived strictly from the transit data in juxtaposition with your natal/horary framework, emphasizing the direct impact of Mars’ shift and its reverberations through the supportive and tension-inducing aspects.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T12:00:04.018Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T12:00:17.516Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the transit elements provided for February 24, 2025, I have isolated the following key transit influences for interpretation:\n\n1.
