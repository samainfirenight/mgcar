Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Is it imminent that Stefan and I will come together in a romantic relationship?\n\n1. Seven of Wands reversed\n2. nine of swords reversed.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
