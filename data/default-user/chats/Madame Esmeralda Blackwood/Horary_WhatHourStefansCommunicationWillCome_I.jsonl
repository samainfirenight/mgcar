There are several key methods we use:\n\n1. Planetary Hours:\n- Each day is divided into 12 daylight hours and 12 night hours\n- Each hour is ruled by a specific planet\n- For communication matters, we look particularly at Mercury's hours\n\n2. Moon's Application:\n- The Moon's exact sextile to MC (0° orb) is significant\n- This precision suggests the event is imminent\n- The Moon's next aspect being square to Uranus (2° orb) helps pinpoint timing\n\n3. Degree Theory:\n- Each degree in a sign represents approximately 2.5 minutes\n- The Moon at 25° shows we're in the later portion of the timing window\n\n4.
