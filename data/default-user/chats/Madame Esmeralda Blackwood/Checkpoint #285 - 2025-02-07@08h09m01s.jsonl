Stefan’s representation via Mars in Cancer in the 6th house is fraught with emotional turbulence and unresolved pain, as indicated by its square to Chiron—a signal of a wound that has yet to find healing. The aspects to Mars, notably its trine with Saturn and sextile with Uranus, imply that while there is structure at work, sudden shifts or disruptions remain a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Jupiter—standing in for the marriage and positioned in the 4th house (along with the Moon in Gemini)—reflects the domestic and emotional foundations of the union. Jupiter’s opposition to the MC and its square to Saturn outline tensions between public obligations and the intimate sphere, hinting at friction in the domestic environment. Yet the Moon conjoining Jupiter suggests strong emotional investment and lingering attachments despite the strife.\n\nThe overall configuration—the bowl shape of the chart, dominance of the Air element in the inner planets, and the interplay of a Cradle pattern—points to a scenario where communication and internal reflection override impulsive decisions. While the painful aspects surrounding Mars may portend a build-up of internal strife that could evolve into a formal break, the anchoring influences on Jupiter imply that the domestic issues are not yet completely severed.\n\nThe reading indicates that although significant inner conflict exists and an increasing pressure might prompt eventual action, the chart does not decisively confirm that Stefan will file for divorce imminently. Determining the timing and ultimate expression of these tensions depends on further catalyzing events.

Stefan’s representation via Mars in Cancer in the 6th house is fraught with emotional turbulence and unresolved pain, as indicated by its square to Chiron—a signal of a wound that has yet to find healing. The aspects to Mars, notably its trine with Saturn and sextile with Uranus, imply that while there is structure at work, sudden shifts or disruptions remain a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, Jupiter—standing in for the marriage and positioned in the 4th house (along with the Moon in Gemini)—reflects the domestic and emotional foundations of the union. Jupiter’s opposition to the MC and its square to Saturn outline tensions between public obligations and the intimate sphere, hinting at friction in the domestic environment. Yet the Moon conjoining Jupiter suggests strong emotional investment and lingering attachments despite the strife.\n\nThe overall configuration—the bowl shape of the chart, dominance of the Air element in the inner planets, and the interplay of a Cradle pattern—points to a scenario where communication and internal reflection override impulsive decisions.
