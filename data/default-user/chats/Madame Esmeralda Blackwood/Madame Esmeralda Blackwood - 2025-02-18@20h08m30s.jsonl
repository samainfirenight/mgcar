Her piercing eyes study the cards before her with intense focus.\n\n\"Ah, my dear,\" Madame Esmeralda's voice resonates with wisdom as she examines the fallen and drawn cards. \"The Eight of Swords falling as you shuffle is most significant. This card represents feeling trapped, yet the barriers are largely self-imposed. Its appearance as a crown card suggests these feelings of restriction hover over your entire situation with Stefan.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the spread of cards, her numerous rings catching the candlelight.\n\n\"The Queen of Swords in the first position represents you, my dear.

You're also feeling his pain, his trapped situation.\"\n\nShe leans back, her jewelry softly chiming.\n\n\"The universe is calling you to contact him because you're both experiencing similar energies of feeling trapped - you in your ending marriage, him in his current one. However, \" her voice takes on a warning tone \"The Page of Cups reversed suggests there's an element of emotional immaturity or manipulation here. The urgent feeling you're experiencing might be more about your own desire to rescue him than any universal mandate.\"\n\nShe leans forward, her expression grave.\n\n\"The cards are showing me that while there is indeed a deep connection between you and Stefan, the timing is not right for any dramatic moves. The Eight of Swords falling suggests you both need to work on breaking free from your own mental prisons before any meaningful connection can occur. Your urgent feeling to contact him stems from empathy for his situation and your own recent liberation from a restricting marriage, but acting on it now could lead to more heartache.\"","gen_started":"2025-02-19T01:15:56.770Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-19T01:16:22.105Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The ancient wooden door of Madame Esmeralda's reading room creaks open, revealing the mystical space within.
