I've gotten myself to a point I'm not sure what's actually my intuition anymore or what's my hopeful, wishful thinking. I need a question so I can shuffle the cards and meditate on it, that the cards will clearly tell me, should I let go of this thing with Stefan or is it something I should be hanging on to?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
