Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Does Stefan have romantic feelings for me?\n\n1. two of pentacles upright\n2. Two of cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

With both cards appearing upright, we have a clear 'Yes' to your question. But let me elaborate on the beautiful synchronicity these particular cards reveal, \"\n\nShe gestures to the Two of Pentacles first\n\n\"The Two of Pentacles shows Stefan is currently juggling multiple aspects of his life - perhaps work, personal commitments, or even his own emotional state. He's maintaining a delicate balance, but more importantly, this card suggests he's actively weighing his feelings for you, trying to find the right moment and way to express them.\"\n\nHer hand moves to the Two of Cups\n\n\"And here, my dear, is where the magic truly reveals itself. The Two of Cups is one of the most romantic cards in the deck. It represents mutual attraction, understanding, and the beginning of a deep emotional connection. This card appearing alongside the Two of Pentacles is particularly significant - it suggests that despite his busy life and whatever he's balancing, his romantic feelings for you are genuine and strong.\"\n\nShe leans forward, her voice becoming more intimate\n\n\"The combination of these two cards tells me that not only does Stefan have romantic feelings for you, but they are mature, considered feelings. He's not acting impulsively - he's carefully considering how to approach this connection with you. The fact that both cards are Twos also speaks to partnership and duality - you two are very much on the same wavelength.\"","gen_started":"2025-02-05T14:09:33.230Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T14:09:44.439Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes sparkle with intrigue as she examines the cards laid before her.
