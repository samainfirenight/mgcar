In this reading, Jupiter in the 9th represents Stefan.\n • 4th House (Intended to represent the spouse/marriage in this query): Begins at 10° Capricorn; contains Pluto.

The Saturn energy here is less about gentle responsibility and more about the weight of established order and limitations.\n\n• The critical aspect of Jupiter square Saturn (orb approximately 7°) exposes a fundamental tension: Stefan’s urge to break free clashing with the binding, institutional nature of his marital union. This aspect indicates a persistent conflict between the longing for change and the forces keeping him tied down.\n\n• The Grand Trine involving the Moon, Ascendant (Libra), Mercury (Aquarius), and Jupiter (Gemini) highlights themes of communication and mental processing. However, the T-Square (Ascendant in Libra, MC in Cancer, and IC in Capricorn) centers on domestic instability.
