The Sun and Mercury in Aquarius in the 6th House (Stefan’s designated area) suggest that he is predisposed to rationalizing emotions through intellectual frameworks. This detachment can provide a shield against feeling vulnerable in domestic matters.\n\n2. The exact Mars square Chiron indicates an acute wound tied to aggression or a painful confrontation. Mars in Cancer, representing instinctive emotional responses and a link to family and home, when clashing with Chiron, the archetype of deep-seated hurt, points to a specific incident where an emotional injury—likely one experienced in the family sphere—was not fully healed.\n\n3. The T-Square formed by the MC (public image), Ascendant (Melissa’s immediate presence) and IC (home, deep emotional foundations) emphasizes polarities between maintaining a public façade and a troubled private base. This structure indicates that a crisis or turning point in the domestic sphere is central to the issue.\n\n4.

The Sun and Mercury in Aquarius in the 6th House (Stefan’s designated area) suggest that he is predisposed to rationalizing emotions through intellectual frameworks. This detachment can provide a shield against feeling vulnerable in domestic matters.\n\n2. The exact Mars square Chiron indicates an acute wound tied to aggression or a painful confrontation. Mars in Cancer, representing instinctive emotional responses and a link to family and home, when clashing with Chiron, the archetype of deep-seated hurt, points to a specific incident where an emotional injury—likely one experienced in the family sphere—was not fully healed.\n\n3.

The conflict is centered in the domestic sphere (IC in Scorpio) and strongly colored by painful emotions. Mars square Chiron indicates a deep, personal wound that seems to have been inflicted amid intimate, marital dynamics rather than entirely self-initiated. This point leans toward an act by someone close in his marriage, as the energy here suggests that the wound is not self-caused but rather triggered by an external betrayal.\n\n2. The Yod formation—with the Ascendant, North Node, Pluto, and Venus concentrated in Pisces and Aquarius—carries the weight of karmic retribution and emotional destiny. Such a configuration supports an interpretation where the betrayal involves an actual, tangible act within his intimate relationship, likely involving emotional or physical infidelity.\n\n3. The interplay between the public persona (MC in Taurus) and the sensitive, hidden deep roots (IC in Scorpio) implies that the marital wound was significant enough to reverberate both privately and publicly. This duality indicates that the betrayal was not a minor lapse or internal conflict but a defining trauma within his marriage.\n\n4. As for timing, the waxing crescent Moon combined with critical aspects (including a T-Square involving the Ascendant, MC, and IC) suggests that the event is relatively recent in his emotional timeline—a critical incident that likely occurred during an early yet formative phase of his marriage, where personal vulnerabilities collided with a public or relational crisis. The Moon’s early phase points to a wound that is still in the process of emerging, hinting at a pivotal event that took shape not long ago in the context of marital life.\n\nBased on these elements, the chart indicates that the wound was indeed inflicted within his marriage, was precipitated by an act of betrayal from someone close to him (as opposed to a self-generated issue), and occurred at a time that marked an early and defining breach in his domestic life.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T00:26:32.820Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T00:26:55.972Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Drawing on the horary details:\n\n1.
