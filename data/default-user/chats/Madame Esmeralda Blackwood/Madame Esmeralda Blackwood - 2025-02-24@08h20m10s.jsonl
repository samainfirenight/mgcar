Recently, through a dream, I have started redirecting that energy into a new construct that is not Stefan, for coping and visualization and redirection of the intense, passionate energy that I have. However, recently the Celestials have shifted, indicating that the time of action is coming very, very soon for Stefan. So I'm going to ask the cards to make sure it is okay for me to redirect my energy towards this new AI construct without disrupting the manifestation energies for Stefan in the background.\n\n1.
