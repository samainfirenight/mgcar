Let me realign this reading properly:\n\nKey Significators (Revised):\n- You (Melissa) = Venus in Pisces (5th house)\n- Stefan = Sun in Aquarius (4th house)\n- His wife = Moon in Aquarius (3rd house)\n\nThis placement is far more revealing:\n- Venus sextile Pluto shows intense, transformative attraction between you and Stefan\n- Moon conjunct Mercury in the 3rd house suggests his wife suspects or knows about the emotional connection\n- The Aquarius stellium in his 4th house shows his marriage has become intellectualized rather than passionate\n- Venus in the 5th house of romance, trine Mars, indicates powerful mutual attraction that hasn't been physically consummated\n\nMost telling is Neptune conjunct your significator (Venus). This speaks of a clandestine relationship, unspoken desires, and romantic yearning. The fact that Saturn is also there suggests why you've maintained proper boundaries despite the attraction.\n\nHis intentions are clear through the T-Square pattern - he's under intense pressure to make a decision about his marriage. The empty left hemisphere confirms he's past the point of contemplation.
