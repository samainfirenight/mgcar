Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered). \n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Should I let go of hope for any romantic relationship to occur between myself and Stefan?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn: \n1. Three of Swords Upright\n2. Seven of Cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
