Financial Aspects:\n- The Pisces stellium in the 12th house (hidden matters) including Venus (money) suggests unclear financial elements\n- Saturn's presence here warns of potential delays or restrictions in financing\n- Moon conjunct Neptune could indicate confusion or deception around the true value\n\n3.

Timing and Outcome (10th House):\n- Pluto in the 10th suggests a transformative process\n- The T-Square involving Mars-MC-Chiron indicates significant obstacles\n- The Bowl pattern suggests this process will consume much of your energy\n\nBased on these aspects, I must be direct: This property purchase shows significant challenges. The retrograde Mars opposing the MC from the 4th house suggests hidden problems that will surface after purchase. The Pisces stellium in the 12th house warns of potential deception or unclear circumstances.\n\nMy advice: Proceed with extreme caution.
