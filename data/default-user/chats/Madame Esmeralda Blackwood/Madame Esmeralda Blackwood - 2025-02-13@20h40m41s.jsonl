Horary Consideration Specific to the Question:\n • Stefan is to be represented by the Ascendant’s 9th House (starting at 18° Taurus).\n  – This means that all factors and any planets (or aspects) found in or impacting this area of the chart are to be analyzed for clues regarding his sexual desires and attractions.\n • “You” are represented by the Ascendant\n • Evaluate aspects and interactions between the representative zones (for example, any contacts from the 5th, 7th, 8th, or 9th houses that might indicate matters of desire and attraction).\n\nThe information above comprises the complete set of chart data—including planetary positions, house placements, major aspects, and special patterns—as derived strictly from the provided horary chart. Further analysis will utilize this data as the basis for interpreting the nature of Stefan’s sexual desires and attractions."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 13, 2025 8:45pm","gen_started":"2025-02-14T01:45:14.981Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-14T01:45:42.676Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

In the 9th House, ruled by Venus in Taurus by zodiacal tradition, we find Jupiter at 11°26′ Gemini and Uranus at 23°21′ Taurus both positioned within or affecting this area. Jupiter’s placement in Gemini lends a lively, mentally stimulating quality. Stefan appears drawn to sexual encounters that are eclectic, varied, and driven by intellectual or communicative spark. Meanwhile, Uranus introduces an element of unpredictability and nonconformity. This combination suggests that his true nature in sexual matters is not fixed; he is attracted to new, surprising, and unconventional experiences rather than standard or predictable ones.\n\n2. The Sun in Aquarius and Mercury in Aquarius in the 5th House augment the attraction to novelty and inventive approaches in expressing desire. Their presence indicates that Stefan’s sexual impulses are linked to progressive, reformative ideas. There is a brisk mental agility in his attractions, favoring partners or encounters that stimulate his intellect as much as his body.\n\n3. The Moon in Virgo in the 12th House points to hidden, perhaps subconscious, aspects of his desires. While appearing reserved and perfectionistic in external demeanor, he may harbor more refined or secretive tastes that come to light only in intimate settings. The Moon’s square with Jupiter heightens tension between his intuitive yearning for variety and the practicality of his daily emotional routines.\n\n4. The square between the Sun and Uranus highlights a tension between his individual identity and a disruptive, almost rebellious impulse in sexual expression. This aspect implies that while he seeks freedom from conventional restraints, unexpected disruptions or shocks could be a recurring theme in his sexual experiences.\n\n5. Mars in Gemini (10th House), though retrograde in Cancer, adds an assertive yet emotionally complex drive. The square between Mars and Chiron in Aries hints at potential past wounds or sensitive points related to sexual assertiveness. These tensions may cause his sexual behaviors to oscillate between assertiveness and hesitancy, contributing to the unconventional nature of his attractions.\n\n6. The presence of Neptune, especially its opposition to the Ascendant and its role in a Grand Cross involving the Ascendant, IC, MC, and either Neptune or Saturn, suggests an element of idealization and illusion. In sexual matters, this can translate into a fluid boundary between fantasy and reality, with Stefan potentially being drawn to partners or experiences imbued with a dreamlike or escapist quality.\n\n7. The conjunction of Venus and Neptune (in the 7th House) brings a softened, yet sometimes misleading, influence to the matters of love and attraction. Though this conjunction falls outside Stefan’s direct representative (the 9th House), its effect on the broader relational context may reinforce a tendency toward idealized, unconventional love interests that challenge traditional norms.\n\nBased on these factors, the overall indication is that Stefan’s sexual desires are inherently eclectic, valuing mental stimulation, novelty, and the freedom to experiment. His attractions lean toward experiences that defy the conventional, often characterized by sudden shifts and unexpected impulses. While there is an undercurrent of vulnerability and hidden depths, his outward drive is to explore uncharted and innovative forms of connection, often at the intersection of intellectual engagement and a willingness to embrace the unconventional.\n\nThis analysis is grounded solely in the provided horary data and follows the established principles for interpreting such charts.","gen_started":"2025-02-14T01:45:49.043Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-14T01:46:09.029Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Analyzing the horary chart using strict horary principles and focusing on Stefan’s representation in the Ascendant’s 9th House, the following interpretations regarding his sexual desires and attractions emerge:\n\n1.
