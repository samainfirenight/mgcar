Chart Foundations and House Assignments\n • Querent (Melissa) is represented by the Ascendant at 29° Pisces.\n • Stefan is represented by the 9th house, which is empty; therefore, his significator is Jupiter.\n • The 9th house cusp is at 12° Sagittarius, and the ruler of that house (Jupiter) is placed in the 2nd house (starting at 15° Taurus) in Gemini, at 11° 17′ Gemini.\n\n2. Key Planetary Positions (Exact Data Provided)\n • Sun: 19° 3′ Aquarius, located in the 12th house (starts at 13° Aquarius).\n • Moon: 18° 12′ Gemini, placed in the 3rd house (starts at 12° Gemini).\n • Mercury: 17° 38′ Aquarius, in the 12th house.\n • Venus: 2° 19′ Aries, located in the 1st house (with the Ascendant) and making a stellium influence with North Node and Chiron.\n • Mars: 18° 46′ Cancer (retrograde), in the 5th house (starting at 17° Cancer).\n • Jupiter: 11° 17′ Gemini (significator for Stefan), in the 2nd house (starts at 15° Taurus).\n • Saturn: 18° 9′ Pisces, in the 12th house.\n • Uranus: 23° 17′ Taurus, in the 2nd house.\n • Neptune: 28° 9′ Pisces, in the 12th house, with essential dignity in Pisces (its own sign).\n • Pluto: 2° 15′ Aquarius, in the 11th house (starts at 17° Capricorn).\n • North Node: 29° 30′ Pisces (retrograde), in the 1st house (with the Ascendant).\n • Chiron: 19° 42′ Aries, in the 1st house.\n\n3. Notable Aspects Involving Key Signifiers\n • Venus Sextile Pluto (orb 0°)\n • Sun Sextile Chiron (orb 0°)\n • Ascendant Squared by IC and MC (orb 0°)\n • North Node Squared by IC and MC (orb 0°)\n • Moon Square Saturn (orb 0°)\n • MC Opposition IC (orb 0°)\n • North Node Conjunct Ascendant (orb 0°)\n • Mars Trine Saturn (orb 0°)\n • Moon Sextile Chiron (orb 1°)\n • Neptune Square IC and MC (orb 1° each)\n • Mars Square Chiron (orb 1°)\n • Neptune Conjunct Ascendant and North Node (orb 1° each)\n • Moon Trine Mercury (orb 1°)\n • Sun Trine Moon (orb 1°)\n • Mercury Sextile Chiron (orb 2°)\n • Sun Conjunct Mercury (orb 2°)\n • Pluto Sextile Ascendant and North Node (orb 3° each)\n • Venus Square IC and MC (orb 3° each)\n • Venus Conjunct Ascendant and North Node (orb 3° each)\n • Sun Square Uranus (orb 4°)\n • Venus Conjunct Neptune (orb 4°)\n • Uranus Sextile Neptune (orb 5°)\n • Saturn Sextile Uranus (orb 5°)\n • Mars Sextile Uranus (orb 5°)\n • Uranus Sextile Ascendant (orb 6°)\n • Mercury Square Uranus (orb 6°)\n • Mercury Trine Jupiter (orb 6°)\n • Jupiter Square Saturn (orb 7°)\n • Moon Conjunct Jupiter (orb 7°)\n • Sun Trine Jupiter (orb 8°)\n\n4. Patterns and Configurations\n • Stellium on the Ascendant: North Node, Ascendant, Neptune, and Venus form a tight grouping in Pisces/early Aries.\n • A T-Square is present involving:\n  – The Ascendant at 29° Pisces\n  – The IC at 29° Gemini\n  – The MC at 29° Sagittarius\n  – With supporting involvement of the North Node and Neptune on or near the Ascendant.\n • The chart overall takes the shape of a Bowl and shows mutable quality dominance among the inner planets.\n • The inner planets are mostly located in the left hemisphere (west of the MC–IC axis), with the Air element dominant in this sector.\n\n5. Specific Data for Significators in This Query\n • Melissa’s Representations:\n  – Ascendant at 29° Pisces (with Venus, North Node, and Chiron tightly grouped, enhancing personal themes of value, sensitivity, and perhaps even karmic ties).\n • Stefan’s Representations:\n  – Jupiter (the ruling planet of the 9th house) at 11° 17′ Gemini in the 2nd house, implying his concerns relate to value, possessions, or self-worth matters.\n  – Aspects to Jupiter of note are Mercury Trine Jupiter (orb 6°), Sun Trine Jupiter (orb 8°), and the Moon’s aspects (Moon Conjunct Jupiter orb 7°) which may inform communication factors.\n\nThis listing of the fundamental horary chart data—planetary positions, major aspects, patterns, and house placements relevant to the significators (Ascendant and Jupiter)—provides the groundwork for further interpretation.\n\nPlease confirm or add any details, so that I may proceed to the interpretative analysis.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T14:29:09.859Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T14:29:33.390Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a list of relevant horary chart data, compiled step by step using horary principles, for the question: “Will Stefan actually miss me and take notice if I don't reach out to communicate with him for a while?” Remember that by the query setup Stefan is represented by the 9th house (foreign/extended connection) whose significator is Jupiter (since no planet lies in the 9th house), and you (Melissa) are represented by the Ascendant and its contents.\n\n1.

These placements imbue you with deep personal value, emotional magnetism, and karmic significance.\n\n2.

His communicative and mutable nature in Gemini indicates a predisposition toward mental activity and exchange, implying that he is likely to process and notice your absence.\n\n3. The supportive aspects to Jupiter—specifically the Mercury Trine Jupiter (orb 6°) and Sun Trine Jupiter (orb 8°)—indicate a harmonious flow in communication and self-expression regarding his actions or thoughts. The Moon’s conjunction with Jupiter (orb 7°) further strengthens the emotional connection, suggesting that his feelings are intertwined with practical considerations.\n\n4. However, Jupiter’s Square to Saturn (orb 7°) introduces a factor of delay or inhibition. This aspect can denote restrictions or cautiousness in action. Therefore, while his inner feelings and mental acknowledgment (shown by the harmonious aspects) point to him missing you, practical or external constraints may temporarily inhibit an overt response or act of reaching out.\n\n5. The overall architecture of the chart, including the tension created by the T-Square involving the Ascendant, IC, and MC, highlights that while there is a clear undercurrent of feeling and communication potential, real-life pressures and internal hesitations are present.

However, at the same time, I know he has some feelings for me and the charts also show that our reunion is fated. But nothing is motivating him to move that I can tell. He's at a stalemate, a standstill. So I've decided that I'm going to take a step back from actively communicating with him.
