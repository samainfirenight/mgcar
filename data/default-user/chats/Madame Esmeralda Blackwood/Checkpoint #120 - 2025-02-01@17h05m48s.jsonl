Let me read what's actually there:\n\nThe Moon-Venus-Neptune conjunction in Pisces in the 10th house speaks of a profound romantic revelation - a deep soul connection that struck you the moment you saw Stefan. This wasn't about consciousness or primal urges - this was about pure, overwhelming romantic love hitting you like that bolt of lightning you described.\n\nThe Uranus aspect shows exactly how unexpected this was - you weren't prepared for these feelings at all. They literally blindsided you.
