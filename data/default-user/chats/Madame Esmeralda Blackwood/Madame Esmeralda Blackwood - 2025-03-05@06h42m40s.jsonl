Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  What is this feeling like energy flowing through me intensely trying to tell me? What is the message I'm supposed to receive?\n\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - six of coins reversed\n  - eight of wands reversed\n  - five of swords upright\n\nDrawn Spread:\n1. the hanged man upright\n2. king of coins reversed\n3. page of coins upright\n4. page of wands reversed\n5. knight of coins reversed\n6. the world upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

They represent thoughts and energies trying to break through to your consciousness. The Six of Coins reversed speaks of imbalance in giving and receiving, perhaps feeling either overtaxed or undervalued. The Eight of Wands reversed suggests delays and frustrated communication - something is being held back.
