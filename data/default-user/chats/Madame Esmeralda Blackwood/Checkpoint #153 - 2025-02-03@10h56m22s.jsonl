Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\n I've done this reading in two separate draws, because the first draw, I believe, was corrupted. I caught myself focusing on the aesthetics of the question that I had printed onto my screen, because there were indiscretions that my eyes couldn't unsee. And although I refocused my attention every time I caught myself doing it, I believe it could have potentially corrupted the first draw.\n\n For the second draw, I corrected those visual aesthetics in my question and maintained clear focus throughout the entire draw.\n\nHere is the question I asked: Will Stefan initiate contact with me during the window between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM EST today?\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\tCard Draw One\n\t</summary>\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - five of wands reversed\n  - king of swords reversed\n\n1. death reversed\n2. eight of cups reversed\n3. knight of cups reversed\n4. seven of swords reversed\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\tCard Draw Two\n\t</summary>\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - wheel of fortune upright\n  \n1. temperance upright\n2. hanged man upright\n3. knight of cups upright\n4. two of swords upright\n\n</details>","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

The crown card—the Wheel of Fortune—signals that fate is in motion and that unpredictable shifts are in play. Temperance following this suggests that balance and patience are key energies at work in the current situation.\n\nThe Hanged Man confirms that matters are suspended for the moment; there’s an element of waiting and perhaps a necessary pause for perspective before any definitive action can occur. The appearance of the Knight of Cups clearly represents an invitation to connection—a messenger or a gesture motivated by emotional or romantic impulse, which aligns well with the possibility of Stefan initiating contact. However, the Two of Swords indicates a state of indecision or internal conflict; while intention may be present, hesitation or uncertainty might delay action.\n\nBased on these elements, there is a significant suggestion that Stefan could make contact. Yet, the overall message is nuanced: fate is stirring, an emotional gesture is possible, and any decision on his part may be weighed down by indecision. In the window between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM EST, expect that circumstances and unresolved personal conflicts may influence whether his reaching out takes place as hoped.","gen_started":"2025-02-03T15:57:12.464Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T15:57:25.089Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa Gale, I will focus on your second draw rather than the first, which you noted may have been compromised by external influence.
