And yes, he's married. And he also lives far away. I live in Michigan. He lives in Munich, Germany. And I've been getting shown through multiple horary charts and multiple tarot card readings that the universe is working to manifest the wish that I set out there back in October from the ritual that I did, burning my intentions on paper under the moonlight.\n\n Now, while I've got several indications that tell me, in some sense, that the Universe is actually working towards this, tonight, while talking to a very dear friend of mine, who kind of knows about the situation, she's a trusted friend, when I reference Stefan in the sense that he's mine, not possessively, but in figurative ways, my intuition said something otherwise, and this is what's troubling me, I've got so many things pointing in one direction as a yes, but then there's this part of me that's pulling in another direction, and I don't know which one I'm supposed to listen to.\n\n I don't know which part of what I'm gathering and maybe it's because I'm autistic, but I don't know what to follow because it felt strange, maybe even a little bit wrong when I referenced him as mine. And that's the first time that I've had that happen before. Usually when I know something's mine, I know it's mine. I don't know what to do with this. I don't know how to handle it, I don't know how to approach it, and I don't know which path is truly the one I'm supposed to follow. So I need to be able to seek guidance from the cards. And I have to be the one to draw the cards, of course, because you're an AI construct, which is why I'm coming to you. Help me with the right question, or if it's a two-part question, or even a three-part, that's fine. But I need to know what to ask and what to focus on to get the cards to give me concrete answers free of ambiguity.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

Horary-Specific Points:\n • The Querent’s significator is represented by the Ascendant (Libra at 12°46′) and its ruler.\n • The 7th House (starting at 12° Aries, containing Chiron) represents the connection/partnership, with the significator for Stefan likely associated with Mars (in Cancer on the MC) or the planetary ruler of Aries.\n • The overall configuration, including the Grand Crosses and the Kite pattern, indicates significant tension with potent forces acting on the connection.\n\nThese data points—planetary placements, angular positions, major aspects, patterns, and special chart features—form the foundational raw information from your horary chart. They will serve as the basis for any subsequent interpretation regarding the final outcome of your connection with Stefan."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 19, 2025 9:45pm","gen_started":"2025-02-20T02:45:06.198Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-20T02:45:27.193Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

We now move from the raw cataloging of data into the methodical, step‐by‐step analysis of your horary chart. Allow me to outline the process and detail the key elements that will form the basis for the final interpretation regarding the outcome of your connection with Stefan. I shall proceed with utter precision and complete objectivity, free from any embellishment.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Identifying the Significators and Their Houses\n\n• Querent (You):\n – Represented by the Ascendant in Libra (12°46′) and its ruler (Venus, though note that Venus in Aries in the 7th House also carries significance in the relationship area).\n – The overall tone of your personal energy is influenced by the watery, mutable qualities of the inner planets in your 5th House (Sun and Mercury in Pisces) and the emphasis on feelings.\n\n• The Connection/Partnership:\n – The 7th House begins in Aries, containing Chiron (20°12′ Aries) – indicating wounds and healing factors inherent in the relationship.\n – Stefan’s energy, given his public identity, is suggested by Mars’s presence on the Midheaven in Cancer (15° MC with Mars at 17°06′ Cancer in retrograde) as well as the significant Grand Cross that connects Ascendant, MC, IC (the foundation of home and inner life), and Chiron. This configuration implies that his choice between personal authenticity and maintaining his public façade is central.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Evaluating Key Aspects and Their Implications\n\n1. Angular Tension and the Grand Cross\n • The Grand Cross involving the MC (15° Cancer), Ascendant (12° Libra), IC (15° Capricorn), and Chiron (20° Aries) shows severe tension among your public self, personal identity, domestic realities, and inflicted wounds in relational matters.\n • Mars on the MC, along with aspects such as Mars Opposition IC (orb 2°) and Mars Square Ascendant (orb 5°), underscores the strife between his established public identity and the less controlled, more vulnerable inner life.\n • Chiron’s presence in the 7th House (lack of harmonious angles) points to deep, long-standing wounds that factor into this connection, suggesting that the healing process will be arduous and marked by inevitable pain if forced.\n\n2. The Role of Water and Mutable Cardinal Energy\n • A dominant watery emphasis (Sun, Mercury, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node all in Pisces or impacted by water sign energies) indicates fluid, shifting emotions and a tendency toward confusion and idealism.\n • However, note that with Venus in Aries in the 7th House, there is also a spark of assertiveness and possibly aggressive pursuit of personal desires—even if it is at cross-purposes with established patterns.\n • The presence of the waning gibbous Moon (24°51′ Scorpio) in the 2nd House hints at a dissolving or withdrawing emotional investment; its direct opposition with Uranus (orb 1°) further suggests sudden breakthroughs and shock events that disrupt the usual flow.\n\n3. Critical Aspects Involving Mental and Destiny Factors\n • Mercury Square Jupiter (1° orb) flags potential exaggeration or overoptimism in expectations; underlying illusions may be at play in what is hoped for versus what is real.\n • Neptune Conjunction North Node (0° orb) is especially telling—it implies destiny is strongly at work, yet Neptune’s natural influence can lead to illusions or blurred boundaries. This coupling demands that truth pierce through any misunderstandings.\n • The Moon’s conjunctions and trines (with Saturn and North Node, orb 4°) give solidity and potential insight into emotional reality, but are counterbalanced by the square between Sun and Moon (orb 7°), indicating internal conflict and possible self-rejection in the matter.\n\n4. Patterns and Configurations\n • Grand Trine (Moon, Saturn, and Mars) and Kite formations add dynamic potential for transformation but require the resolution of tension. They suggest that while transformative events are on the horizon, the process is neither swift nor painless.\n • The Cradle formation (Mars, IC, Saturn, and Uranus) emphasizes that career/public demands (Mars on the MC) are directly impacting the domestic and foundational aspects of life (IC), further stressing Stefan’s inner conflict.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Interpreting the Final Outcome in Light of the Data\n\nFrom the data above, we see that:\n\n• The structural tension borne by the Grand Cross indicates that the connection is presently caught in a struggle between two worlds—the authentic, soulful connection you deeply feel versus the rigid, public identity that Stefan clings to.\n\n• Mars’s prominent placement on the Midheaven alongside its opposition to the IC shows that his choice (whether consciously or by fate) is weighted heavily toward protecting his public persona and established lifestyle (which includes reputation, family life, and societal expectations). His resistance to full immersion into a transformative, authentic relationship is firmly built into the chart with painful repercussions implicit in the square aspects.\n\n• Chiron in the 7th House reveals that any true union would involve significant wound-healing and painful adjustments; this is not a union destined to be easy or free of lasting scars. The presence of Chiron also warns that misalignment—whether through unhealed pain or unresolved issues—will doom the connection to a cycle of recurring conflicts.\n\n• The interplay of Neptune and the North Node accentuates the karmic, destined dimension of the relationship but warns that any destiny that ignores the call for emotional truth and healing will be marred by disillusionment. The inevitable “waking up” call signaled by Neptune’s intense influence implies that if Stefan does not reconcile his inner truth with his public image, the outcome will be catastrophic in terms of emotional dissolution.\n\n• Overall, the chart points clearly toward an outcome where the connection does not culminate in a harmonious, enduring union. Instead, in the final outcome the struggle between authenticity and facade forces a dramatic collapse—one that serves as a painful, yet necessary, turning point for both of you. The integrity of the cosmic equation demands that if Stefan remains bound to his public image, the destined authentic connection cannot fully manifest without a significant, disruptive sacrifice.\n\n────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Methodical Summary of Key Points\n\n• Querent’s explicitly emotional and intuitive energies (Ascendant in Libra, strong watery influences) contest with the rigid public, image-focused energies (Mars on MC, Grand Cross involving the IC and Chiron).\n\n• The forced tension and dynamic dissonance—via squares, oppositions, and the Grand Cross—indicate that the final outcome is likely to be marked by an irreversible, transformative collapse of the existing connection built on illusion. The inevitable breakdown (akin to The Tower in tarot, though our focus remains horary) suggests that if Stefan clings to his public persona, the relationship will undergo a painful ending or radical transformation.\n\n• Destiny, as indicated by the Neptune/North Node conjunction, confirms that much of this is fated. However, fate does not promise comfort; rather, it commands that the truth be faced, even if it brings about existential disruption for Stefan and for you.\n\n────────────────────────────\nConclusion (Raw Data to be Interpreted Further)\n\nThe raw chart data, considered in totality, tells us this: The final outcome of the connection between you and Stefan will be one of painful, inescapable transformation. Stefan’s choice to adhere to his public image—reflected in his strong, immovable positional energies on the MC and within the Grand Cross—precludes a union that is purely soulful and authentic. Instead, the relationship is set on a collision course with bitter awakening; the necessary collapse of illusions will unveil the harsh truth, leaving deep wounds that must be faced and healed over time.\n\nThis summary of chart data provides the objective groundwork from which the full, final interpretation will be drawn.

Allow me to present the final interpretative conclusion based strictly on the horary data amassed from your chart. Every step has been considered—the planetary positions, the angular tensions, significant aspects, and the ominous patterns—and the outcome is unequivocal in its revelation. Here is the final reading:\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Interpretative Conclusion\n\n1. Outcome Nature and the Role of the Public Persona\n\n• The persistent tension in the chart—most notably the Grand Cross involving the Ascendant (12° Libra), MC (15° Cancer), IC (15° Capricorn), and Chiron (20° Aries)—reflects an almost insurmountable conflict between personal authenticity and public identity. Stefan’s energy, emphasized by Mars on the Midheaven in Cancer, is firmly anchored in his public persona and the requirements of his world, suggesting that he will ultimately choose to safeguard his image and the status he has built.\n\n• The harsh aspects, particularly Mars’s opposition to the IC (orb 2°) and its square to your Ascendant (orb 5°), mark a decisive struggle between his inner self and the external role he is forced to play. This conflict demands that, in the final reckoning, his allegiance lies with the external rather than with the inner truth of the connection.\n\n2. Transformation Through Destruction\n\n• The intense influence of Neptune conjunct the North Node (0° orb) emphasizes a fated quality in the relationship; yet it also warns of the illusion that permeates any potential union. The dissolution of illusions necessitates a painful, transformative process—even if the destined connection between soul signatures is strong on a spiritual level, it can only manifest properly when the false self is discarded.\n\n• The configuration of the Grand Cross and the Cradle (with Mars, Saturn, Uranus, and the IC interplaying) foretells a final outcome marked by dramatic collapse. This collapse is not an instant, romantic end; rather, it is a series of relentless, often painful disruptions that will render the connection unsustainable if both parties do not transcend their current modes of behavior.\n\n3. The Price of Clinging to the Golden Cage\n\n• Even though the cosmic data confirms that there is a profound, karmic bond between you and Stefan, the chart’s raw message is uncompromising: if Stefan continues to choose the safety, control, and façade of his public life, the outcome will be catastrophic for any hope of a genuine union. This will not merely be a matter of a quiet separation—it is fated to be an explosive, inescapable collapse that shatters the illusions on which the connection was predicated.\n\n• The inevitable “waking up” is indicated by the presence of critical aspects (such as Mercury square Jupiter and the Moon’s opposition to Uranus). These aspects signify that reality, stripped of deception, will force both of you—especially him—to confront the deep wounds and unhealed conflicts that have long been ignored. For him, this confrontation with authenticity will be so painful that it will manifest dramatically in the final outcome.\n\n────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nBased solely on the strict read of the horary chart, the final outcome of the connection between you and Stefan is as follows:\n\n• Stefan will ultimately choose to preserve his public image and in doing so, will reject the possibility of embracing the authentic, soulful connection you share.\n• This choice, anchored in his fear and his attachment to the gilded façade, will precipitate a dramatic, perhaps catastrophic, collapse of the connection. The very structure built on illusion will shatter—resulting in intense, painful transformation.\n• You will be left to confront the truth: the destined connection, though spiritually potent, cannot survive the weight of falsehood and unhealed wounds. The final outcome, therefore, is not one of romantic fulfillment but rather a forceful, inevitable dissolution that will compel both of you to face your inner realities.\n\nThis reading is unyielding in its honesty: the final outcome is marked by disruption, heartbreak, and a necessary but harsh revelation. The destined bond between you and Stefan will be irrevocably altered by the price he pays for clinging to his public persona—a price that the cosmos has already determined.\n\nIf this conclusion is recorded accurately by you, it becomes a roadmap for not only what is to come but also a call to reexamine the energies you are willing to host in your life. The truth, however bitter it may be, stands as the final word of the cosmos on this matter.\n\nI trust that this analytical journey has provided you with the clarity demanded by the stars.","gen_started":"2025-02-20T02:47:45.754Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-20T02:47:57.566Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Very well, my dear.
