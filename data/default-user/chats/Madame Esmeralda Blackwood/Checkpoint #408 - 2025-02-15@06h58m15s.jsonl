{"name":"Melissa Gale","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"February 15, 2025 6:48am","mes":" I had a very strange dream that, for whatever reason, my perfectly maintained and mint-conditioned Mustang, when I had it running, as I typically do throughout the winter season and then in the spring, well, this would have been the spring, and I was letting it run to recirculate oils and whatnots, anyway, it got hot, tremendously overheated, for whatever reason the car had a turbo on it, which is not something that actually exists on a car, plus it's a V8 engine. Anyway, it was overheated, and I was helping my now ex-husband clean up items in the yard in preparation for something, but I don't know what that something was, my daughter was helping too, and there was a lot of garbage, and one of my husband's, ex-husband, close friends, his name is Brian Kelly, still haven't figured out why he was in the dream, but he was there, and his wife Kim, and Brian was wanting to look at my car which is how we discovered that it was getting overheated because I saw water dripping and smelled the antifreeze and he was like, no, that doesn't sound right. Oh, and initially there was something rattling in the car and I told him, oh yeah, that's right, because the exhaust had a bracket to come loose and I needed to tighten it back up and that's when he said, no, no, there's something else and then we discovered that the car was getting hot so we shut it off and moved it down to the road and then got some air going through it and I used the momentum of the gradual slope on the road to drive the car and get air in it without running the engine which is not something I would typically do but for whatever reason this is what I was doing in the dream and then after a period of time started the car up and it had cooled down enough to be driven so Brian gets into the car and then suddenly it has two steering wheels I'm not sure what that was about but I was in the passenger seat and Brian was in the driver's seat but I was the one driving . and Edward and Brian's wife Kim stayed behind and continued trying to pick up things and clean up the yard even though Brian and Kim were getting ready to leave but because Brian got into the car with me they continued to work. Anyway for whatever reason it was like I just knew that the reason me and Brian were sneaking off is just like that because we were sneaking off but I've never had any kind of feelings or desires for Brian so this didn't make any sense either but my daughter Kayla also gets into the back seat of the car . and eventually because the car was doing good again I asked Brian if he wanted to drive it and he said yeah so it was like I flipped some kind of a proverbial switch because there is no switch like this in that car it made no sense but I flipped the controls to where he could drive and so we drove around and it ended up being that we were on Kentucky back roads at this time which is back in my home state where I haven't lived for 13 years and then when we got to a place and then when we got to a place that he was okay to not drive anymore and just wanted to go back he gave the controls to me and for some reason I was really happy oh I was really happy because we tested the turbo and everything worked flawlessly like it was supposed to and the car immediately responded like it should have and I gave Brian a hug and a kiss on his cheek although inside of me I knew that I wanted to do more and he also knew that I wanted to do more and then he became very flirty and we talked about his age and I was very surprised because I expected Brian to be much older than Edward than what he was because Edward is 64 and Brian is 68 . And Brian was like, no, we're the same age, you know, we went to college together. And I was like, very shocked, like I just thought you were so much older than him.  and so we take the car back even though Brian was holding me in his arms and I was supposed to be driving and Kayla was very surprised but we go back to where Edward and Kim were cleaning up and acting like nothing was going on even though nothing really did go on  and we get the car parked properly and start helping everybody to finish the cleanup. And that's when I woke up is when we were helping to finish the cleanup. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

Your dream is quite the tapestry of symbols and emotions, isn't it? Let us unravel this together, shall we?\n\nFirst, let's address the star of your dream - your beloved Mustang. In dreams, vehicles often represent our journey through life, our means of progress. Your Mustang, typically well-maintained and in mint condition, symbolizes your usual state of being - controlled, powerful, and well-put-together. However, in this dream, it's experiencing issues. This suggests that you're feeling some turbulence in your life's journey.\n\nThe overheating of the engine is particularly telling. Heat in dreams often represents passion, anger, or intense emotions. The fact that your car is overheating suggests that you're dealing with some overwhelming feelings that you're struggling to keep in check. The addition of a turbo - something that doesn't exist in reality - could represent an added pressure or expectation you're feeling, perhaps related to your situation with Stefan.\n\nNow, let's talk about the setting. You're cleaning up the yard with your ex-husband and daughter, preparing for something unknown. This cleanup could symbolize your efforts to put your past in order, to clear away the debris of your previous relationship to make room for something new. The fact that you don't know what you're preparing for suggests uncertainty about your future.\n\nEnter Brian Kelly - a figure from your past who isn't particularly significant in your waking life. In dreams, sometimes people represent aspects of ourselves or situations we're dealing with. Brian's presence, and your unexpected attraction to him in the dream, could be a manifestation of your conflicted feelings about Stefan.\n\nThe two steering wheels in the car is a fascinating detail. This could represent a feeling of shared control or perhaps a conflict between what you want and what you feel you should do. The fact that you're in the passenger seat but still driving suggests that you feel you're not fully in control of your life's direction right now.\n\nYour daughter's presence in the backseat could symbolize your concerns about how your emotional journey affects her. She's along for the ride, so to speak, in whatever decisions you make.\n\nThe shift to Kentucky back roads is interesting. Often, dreams take us to places from our past when we're dealing with unresolved issues or emotions. This could suggest that you're revisiting old patterns or feelings in your current situation.\n\nYour happiness when the car performs well with the new turbo could represent your hope that despite the turbulence and heat (intense emotions) you're experiencing, everything will work out in the end.\n\nThe flirtatious interaction with Brian, someone you're not actually attracted to in real life, could be your subconscious exploring the idea of new romantic possibilities. The surprise about his age could reflect your feelings about Stefan - perhaps you're realizing that age differences aren't as significant as you once thought.\n\nNow, my dear, let's tie this all back to your situation with Stefan. Your dream suggests that you're dealing with intense emotions (the overheating car) and feeling somewhat out of control (the two steering wheels). You're trying to clear away the past (cleaning the yard) to make room for something new, but you're uncertain about what that might be.\n\nThe attraction to Brian in the dream, someone you're not actually interested in, could be your mind's way of processing your feelings for Stefan. It's as if your subconscious is saying, \"What if you felt this way about someone else?\" This could be a way of testing your feelings for Stefan or exploring the idea of moving on.\n\nHowever, the fact that you return to help with the cleanup at the end suggests that you're not ready to abandon your current path just yet. You're still working through things, still trying to put your life in order.\n\nAs for whether Stefan has feelings for you or whether you should hang on - dreams can't give us definitive answers about other people's feelings. What they can do is help us understand our own emotions and desires.\n\nYour dream suggests that you're experiencing intense emotions, dealing with uncertainty, and perhaps feeling a lack of control in your life. It also indicates that you're open to new possibilities, even if they're unexpected.\n\nMy advice to you, dear Melissa, is this: Continue to work on clearing away the debris of the past. Be patient with the intense emotions you're experiencing - they're part of your journey. And most importantly, trust in your ability to navigate this complex situation. Just as you managed to cool down the overheating car in your dream, you have the power to manage your emotions and steer your life in the direction you choose.\n\nRemember, the universe may be working on your situation with Stefan, but you are an active participant in your own destiny. Listen to your intuition, be open to unexpected possibilities, and above all, be true to yourself.\n\nNow, my dear, is there anything else you'd like to explore about this dream or your feelings?","gen_started":"2025-02-15T12:07:38.048Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-15T12:07:58.748Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Ah, my dear Melissa.

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my misinterpretation. Let's delve deeper into this age aspect of your dream, shall we?\n\nIf age isn't an issue for you in relationships, then the surprise about Brian's age in your dream likely represents something else entirely. Dreams often use symbols and situations that may seem straightforward but actually represent deeper, more complex issues.\n\nIn this case, the surprise about Brian's age could symbolize a revelation or realization about Stefan that you weren't expecting. It's not about the number of years, but rather about your perception of him. Perhaps you're discovering layers to Stefan's personality or situation that you hadn't considered before.\n\nThe fact that Brian said, \"No, we're the same age, you know, we went to college together,\" could represent a desire for equality or shared experiences with Stefan. It might suggest that you're looking for common ground or shared understanding in your connection with him.\n\nYour shock in the dream about thinking Brian was \"so much older\" than Edward could reflect feelings of uncertainty about Stefan. Perhaps you're realizing that your initial perceptions of him or your situation with him might not be entirely accurate. This could be your subconscious prompting you to reassess your understanding of Stefan and your potential relationship with him.\n\nMoreover, the age discussion in your dream might be less about chronological age and more about maturity, life experience, or compatibility. It could be highlighting questions you have about whether you and Stefan are at similar stages in life, despite any age difference.\n\nThe dream might also be using the age surprise as a metaphor for other unexpected revelations or realizations you're having about Stefan or your feelings for him. It could be suggesting that there's more to learn and understand about this situation than you initially thought.\n\nLastly, the age discussion could be a representation of time itself.

Now we're getting to the heart of the matter. Your insight is truly illuminating. Let's explore this mirror image, this role reversal, shall we?\n\nIn Munich, it was Stefan who was surprised by your age, finding you younger than he expected. In your dream, you were the one surprised by Brian's age, thinking him older than he was. This reversal is profoundly significant.\n\nDreams often use such reversals to help us process our experiences and emotions from different perspectives. In this case, your subconscious seems to be allowing you to step into Stefan's shoes, to experience the surprise and perhaps the delight he felt upon learning your age.\n\nThis role reversal could be serving several purposes:\n\n1. Empathy and Understanding: By experiencing a similar surprise about age from the other side, your dream might be helping you understand Stefan's reaction more deeply. It's as if your subconscious is saying, \"See how it feels? This is what Stefan experienced.\"\n\n2. Validation: The positive reaction you had in the dream to Brian being younger than expected might reflect your hope or belief that Stefan's surprise at your age was a positive thing. It's as if your subconscious is reinforcing the idea that age can be a pleasant surprise in a potential romantic connection.\n\n3. Exploration of Feelings: Your dream might be helping you process your own feelings about the age difference between you and Stefan. By reversing the roles, it allows you to explore these feelings from a different angle.\n\n4. Desire for Connection: The fact that this age revelation led to flirtation and closeness in your dream might reflect your desires for your relationship with Stefan. It could be expressing your hope that your age difference could be a point of attraction or connection rather than a barrier.\n\n5. Processing Unresolved Emotions: Dreams often help us work through unresolved emotions or experiences. This dream might be your mind's way of revisiting and processing the emotions you felt during that conversation with Stefan in Munich.\n\n6. Highlighting Significance: By mirroring this specific conversation in your dream, your subconscious is underlining its importance. It suggests that this moment, this revelation about age, holds particular significance in your feelings about Stefan and your potential relationship.\n\nThe fact that Brian in your dream said, \"No, we're the same age, you know, we went to college together,\" is particularly interesting. This could represent a desire for commonality or shared experiences with Stefan, despite your age difference. It might be expressing a hope that you and Stefan can find common ground and shared understanding, just as Edward and Brian (in the dream) shared their college experience.\n\nMoreover, your surprise in the dream at Brian being younger than you thought could reflect a realization about Stefan. Perhaps you're coming to see him as more youthful in spirit than you initially thought, or you're realizing that the age difference between you feels less significant than you originally believed.\n\nLastly, this role reversal could be your subconscious way of equalizing the playing field between you and Stefan. By putting you in the position of being surprised about age, it's as if your dream is saying, \"You're both capable of surprising each other.
