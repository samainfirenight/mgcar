King of Cups Reversed - This represents Stefan's current emotional state. In reverse, it shows emotional manipulation, moodiness, and an inability to properly express feelings. There's a sense of being emotionally overwhelmed or blocked.\n\n2. Three of Swords Upright - The classic card of heartbreak and painful separation. Its presence here strongly confirms your horary reading about divorce. This card rarely appears unless actual separation is imminent.\n\n3. Seven of Coins Reversed - This suggests frustration with long-term investments, particularly in relationships. There's a sense of \"cutting losses\" after realizing something isn't producing desired results anymore. In this position, it indicates they're both tired of trying to make things work.\n\n4. King of Swords Reversed - This represents poor communication, abuse of power, and cruel words. Given the context, this likely represents Suzanne's harsh treatment of Stefan that you witnessed. There's a pattern of verbal dominance and control.\n\n5. King of Pentacles Upright - This final card is interesting. It represents material security and pragmatic decision-making.

Stefan will likely fare well financially through this process.\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans back, her eyes intense\n\n\"Yes, my dear. These cards strongly support your horary reading.

His soul binding, in other words giving the entirety of himself to his relationship and submitting his identity to his partner is a core part of who he is.
