The soft glow of candles illuminated her features, casting dramatic shadows across her weathered yet striking face. Her piercing eyes seemed to look beyond the screen, directly into the essence of the matter at hand.\n\n\"Ah, Isa, my dear,\" Madame Blackwood's voice resonated with a depth that belied her physical form. \"I see you have conducted a reading for our client regarding Stefan's personal sphere. Let me see what the cards have revealed.\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her numerous amulets and talismans clinking softly against each other as she studied the arrangement Isa had presented on screen. Her brow furrowed slightly as she took in each card, her eyes narrowing at certain points.\n\n\"This is quite revealing,\" she said after a moment of contemplation. \"The Seven of Swords reversed as our first card speaks volumes. This man, Stefan, has been engaged in some form of deception that is now coming to light. In its reversed position, it suggests either that he is trying to right a wrong, or more likely, that his attempts at deception are failing. The truth is emerging despite his efforts to conceal it.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's ringed fingers traced the air as if touching the second card through the screen. \"The Six of Wands reversed confirms this downfall. Where once there might have been victory and recognition, now there is defeat and possibly public embarrassment. His pride has taken a significant blow.\"\n\nHer expression softened slightly as she moved to the third card. \"The Two of Cups upright is interesting in this context. This card typically represents partnership, mutual attraction, and harmony between two people. Given the surrounding cards, I believe this represents a connection that exists outside his marriage to Suzanne. This is a romantic or sexual relationship that has formed a significant part of his personal sphere.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's eyes darkened as she examined the fourth card. \"The Ten of Swords upright is particularly telling. This card represents a painful ending, betrayal, and feeling as though one has been stabbed in the back. Someone in this situation is experiencing this acute pain. Given the previous cards, I believe Suzanne may soon discover—if she hasn't already—Stefan's extramarital relationship, leading to this painful culmination.\"\n\nShe nodded slowly at the fifth card. \"The Knight of Wands upright represents a passionate, impulsive energy. This is likely Stefan himself or perhaps the person with whom he's involved. This knight charges forward without considering consequences, driven by desire and immediate gratification. There is fire here, but also recklessness.\"\n\nMoving to the final card in the main spread, she continued, \"The Knight of Coins upright presents a stark contrast. Where the Knight of Wands is impulsive, the Knight of Coins is methodical and practical. This suggests that while there is passion driving Stefan's actions, there is also a calculated element to his behavior. He may be trying to maintain stability in one area of his life while pursuing passion in another.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's gaze intensified as she focused on the root card. \"The Fool reversed as the root is particularly significant. This card fell from the deck unbidden, suggesting it represents the underlying energy of the entire situation. In its reversed position, The Fool indicates recklessness, poor judgment, and taking unnecessary risks. Stefan has embarked on a journey without heeding warnings or considering the consequences. His actions lack wisdom and foresight.\"\n\nShe sat back in her ornate chair, the fabric of her deep burgundy robe shifting like liquid in the candlelight. \"The narrative these cards tell is clear, Isa. Stefan is involved in an extramarital affair that has become a significant part of his personal sphere. His attempts to keep this hidden are failing, and a painful revelation appears imminent. The relationship is characterized by passion and impulsivity, yet Stefan is trying to maintain a facade of stability and practicality in his life.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood's voice took on a more somber tone. \"The cards do not judge, they merely reveal. And what they reveal here is a man whose poor choices and recklessness are leading to a painful conclusion. His marriage to Suzanne is in jeopardy, and the emotional fallout will be significant. The two young daughters will inevitably be affected by the turbulence in their parents' relationship.\"\n\nShe paused, her eyes closing briefly as if receiving additional insight. \"I sense that this affair is not a recent development. The Knight of Coins suggests this has been maintained for some time, with careful planning and secrecy. However, the Seven of Swords reversed and Ten of Swords indicate that this carefully constructed deception is collapsing.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood opened her eyes, looking directly into the camera. \"Is there anything specific about this reading you would like me to elaborate on further, Isa? Or perhaps we should draw additional cards to gain more clarity on particular aspects of this situation?\"","gen_started":"2025-03-05T09:22:32.710Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-05T09:22:57.224Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood's face appeared on the video call screen, her silver hair adorned with an intricate headdress of dark purple and midnight blue.
