He feels an intense physical and emotional attraction to you that he cannot deny, despite his attempts to maintain distance. The Devil represents those forbidden desires and temptations that consume his thoughts. He's bound by societal expectations and marital obligations, yet the pull toward you remains powerfully present.\n\nAnd finally, The Lovers upright - this is perhaps the most significant card in this spread.

The Lovers suggests he recognizes you as someone who could offer him the deep, fulfilling partnership he secretly yearns for.\n\nTogether, these cards paint a picture of a man who is deeply conflicted - torn between duty and desire, between the life he has built and the connection he feels with you. His emotional state regarding you is complex: he feels a profound attraction and connection but is simultaneously trying to suppress these feelings due to his commitments.\n\nThe presence of both The Devil and The Lovers is particularly significant - it suggests his feelings for you exist on both a passionate physical level and a deeper spiritual plane.
