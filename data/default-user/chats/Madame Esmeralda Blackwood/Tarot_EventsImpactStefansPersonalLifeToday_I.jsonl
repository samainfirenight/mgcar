Let me explain what I see:\n\nThe Eight of Swords reversed suggests a breaking free from self-imposed restrictions or denial. In this position, it often indicates someone who has been keeping themselves trapped in a situation is finally ready to see the truth and break free.\n\nThe Ten of Pentacles reversed is particularly troubling here - it speaks of a potential disruption to family foundations and established structures. In the context of marriage, this can indicate serious instability or the crumbling of what was thought to be secure.\n\nThe King of Swords reversed suggests a man - likely Stefan himself - who may be acting with poor judgment or misuse of power. There's a sense of emotional manipulation or harsh communication coming.\n\nAnd finally, the Page of Cups reversed,  pauses and leans forward, studying the card intently This suggests disappointed expectations in matters of the heart, or emotional news that will be poorly received.\n\nTogether, my dear, these cards are warning of a significant disruption today. I sense that Stefan's marriage is about to face a serious test - likely through the revelation of information that has been kept hidden.
