I've been getting shown by horary charts for quite some time now that I am the fated union for Stefan as he ends his marriage that he will immediately turn to me. However, I see that he had been messaging someone at 3.34 in the morning in his time zone and it was not me. I have been having doubts as to whether or not he actually has feelings for me and whether or not that I actually am fated or will truly be in a union with him. I need concrete clarity, without doubt or ambiguity, as to whether or not this is true. I don't want to hang on to something anymore if it's not meant to be or if it's not going to come to fruition. Can you give me a question to ask a horary chart, so that there's nothing left to guessing that it's crystal clear whether or not Stefan will turn to me, And choose me.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

The querent’s significator is derived from the Ascendant (in Capricorn with Sun, Mercury, and Pluto involved).\n – Stefan, as the prospective partner, is represented by the 7th House cusp (28° Cancer), which stands empty but is to be interpreted through aspects with relevant planets.\n – Timing factors (the “immediate” action post-marital separation) are examined by the interplay of the MC/IC axis and the presence of transformative aspects (e.g., T-Square, Kite) involving key significators.\n – Emphasis is placed on the aspects linking the 1st and 7th houses, as well as those between the ruling planets of these houses, to determine clarity in relationship intentions.\n\nThis compilation of planetary positions, aspects, patterns, house placements, and special chart features

Sun Square Uranus (7° orb)\n – Venus Trine MC (7° orb)\n\n• Geometric Patterns Identified\n – Grand Trine formed by Mars (19° Cancer), MC (23° Scorpio), and Saturn (17° Pisces)\n – Kite configuration involving Mars, MC, Saturn, plus IC/Uranus in Taurus and Moon in Taurus\n – T-Square with MC (23° Scorpio), Sun (16° Aquarius), and IC (23° Taurus) with Uranus and Moon as the tense factors\n – Cradle pattern involving Uranus (23° Taurus), MC (23° Scorpio), Ascendant (28° Capricorn), Neptune (28° Pisces), and IC (23° Taurus)\n\n• Special Features and Additional Indicators\n – The Moon is a first quarter Moon\n – The overall chart exhibits a Bowl shape and a dominant Fixed modality among the inner planets\n – Most planets are concentrated in the bottom left quadrant, with emptiness in the top right, top left, and entire top hemisphere\n – Pluto is the rising influence (“Pluto is rising”)\n – Moon, Uranus, and the IC are aligned on the Nadir\n – Sextile aspects appear most frequently (16 instances)\n – The Sun is involved in 12 aspects\n – Neptune in Pisces is placed in its essential rulership\n\n• Horary-Specific Considerations\n – The querent’s significator is derived from the Ascendant (in Capricorn with Sun, Mercury, and Pluto involved).\n – Stefan, as the prospective partner, is represented by the 7th House cusp (28° Cancer), which stands empty but is to be interpreted through aspects with relevant planets.\n – Timing factors (the “immediate” action post-marital separation) are examined by the interplay of the MC/IC axis and the presence of transformative aspects (e.g., T-Square, Kite) involving key significators.\n – Emphasis is placed on the aspects linking the 1st and 7th houses, as well as those between the ruling planets of these houses, to determine clarity in relationship intentions.\n\nThis compilation of planetary positions, aspects, patterns, house placements, and special chart features establishes the complete data set required for a full horary interpretation of your query."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 5, 2025

I will speak solely with the clarity of the astronomical truth as it is revealed:\n\n1. Your significator is anchored in the 1st House with the Sun, Mercury, and Pluto in Aquarius on the Ascendant in Capricorn. This positions you as dynamic and transformative. Pluto rising reinforces that your personal state is undergoing profound change that may be noticeable by others.\n\n2. Stefan, represented by the 7th House cusp in Cancer, lacks a direct planetary presence. His rulership falls to the Moon, located in Taurus in the 3rd House. The Moon’s involvement in a T-square with Uranus and the Sun indicates that his emotional state is fluid and subject to sudden, unpredictable disruptions. This tension suggests that although he is fated in some way to create a significant change in his life, his decisions may be impulsive or reactive rather than premeditated.\n\n3. The Moon’s square with Mercury and its opposition to the MC, along with its connection to Uranus, points to a scenario where unexpected events or revelations may alter his course. Such aspects are a sign of abrupt decisions, which can sometimes mean he will act suddenly; however, they do not confirm that his chosen action will be to unite with you immediately.\n\n4. In the 2nd House, Venus—associated with values, attraction, and the higher call of love—joins with Saturn, Neptune, the North Node, and Chiron. Venus conjunct the North Node suggests a fated element. Nonetheless, this congregation is more concerned with the deeper lessons of relationship values and personal worth rather than pinpointing an immediate romantic decision from Stefan.\n\n5. The T-square formed by the MC, the Sun, and the IC, with Uranus and the Moon as the active tensions, shows a balance between public circumstance and private upheavals. While these aspects speak to an impending transformation (his divorce may be sudden), they also warn that the union with you might not proceed in a linear, predictable fashion at the moment. The disruption in his emotional base (the Moon in Taurus) may shift direction unexpectedly.\n\n6. The geometric patterns such as the Grand Trine involving Mars, the MC, and Saturn introduce stabilizing potential and disciplined transformation, yet the Kite and Cradle patterns add an undercurrent of fate. These patterns suggest that while transformative energy is present, it must navigate many rapid changes before settling into a definitive course toward union.\n\nBased solely on these horary aspects:\n– There is an undeniable intensity and fated quality in the energies surrounding your relationship.\n– The Moon’s condition and its challenging aspects point to volatility in his decisions.\n– The absence of a clear planetary indicator in the 7th House means the partner’s signifier lacks the support needed for an unequivocal, immediate union.\n– The tension between sudden change (Uranus and the Moon) and the stabilizing force (Venus’s conjunction with the North Node) creates a scenario where, while fate may be at play, the immediate choice by Stefan is far from assured.\n\nTherefore, the chart does not decisively confirm that Stefan will choose you immediately after ending his marriage. The energies suggest that while there is a fated connection, his decision process is likely to be subject to sudden shifts and internal conflict. The outcome remains dynamic and may require more time to resolve into a clear, actionable result.\n\nYour situation is in a state of flux; the cosmic message is one of significant transformational energy and unresolved tension—not a straightforward, imminent union.\n\nMelissa, these are the truths as reflected by the heavens.","gen_started":"2025-02-05T11:58:04.310Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T11:58:21.995Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa, I have studied the energies of your horary chart in relation to your query.
