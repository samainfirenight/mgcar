Eclipses often mark moments when slowly building tensions erupt into a phase of transformation. From what the chart declares, you can expect the dynamics to shift—this eclipse is likely to offer that “concrete” moment during which your mind begins to regain its footing.\n\n• To be specific, the transitional energy around the New Moon phase following the waning phase of your current distress is anticipated to start emerging within roughly three to four weeks from now, with the most promising surge of clarity appearing shortly before or in tandem with the solar eclipse on March 29, 2025.\n\nBased on these elements in your chart, combined with the context of your Nine of Swords energy, the indication is that a significant easing of your depressive state will begin to manifest in about three to four weeks, culminating in a concrete transformative breakthrough around the solar eclipse on March 29, 2025."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 6, 2025 7:18am","gen_started":"2025-02-06T12:18:47.171Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-06T12:18:59.650Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

This can't happen. Why does the universe want my life to end? My divorce is final on the 14th of February and I'm supposed to be buying a house within the next 30 days.

Instead, they reveal that you are in the midst of an intensely painful and transformative period—one that forces a shedding of outworn structures to pave the way for a deeper inner clarity. The configurations, such as the tight Mars square Chiron and the Yod formation, point to acute internal suffering that you are experiencing and which may affect your day-to-day stability. This pain is real and deeply felt, but it is not a predestined curse. It is the universe’s way of demanding that old patterns, which no longer serve you in your healing, be confronted even if the process is abrupt and harsh.\n\nRegarding your career and other commitments, the charts indicate that this period of inner turmoil might indeed disrupt your current life structure. Notably, the potential for loss of stability—such as the risk to your career—arises from the clash between your need for security and the disruptive transformative forces at work during this cycle. The solar eclipse in Aries on March 29, 2025, marks a critical turning point. It is not a final ending but rather a moment when the magnitude of the current energies begins to shift. This eclipse provides a concrete marker from which the transformational journey may take root, allowing you a chance to reorganize and reestablish a more authentic and sustainable footing.\n\nIn practical terms, the reading shows that while the energies now are almost overwhelming, a significant shift is indicated within a month or so, culminating around that eclipse. The intense pressures you feel are a sign of an impending breakthrough, although the process might continue to be turbulent for a time. The universe does not “want” your life to end; it is urging you to dismantle aspects of your environment and internal framework that are no longer working for you, so that you can rebuild on a more secure and truthful foundation.\n\nI advise you to consider ways to support yourself during this period with professional guidance and personal safeguards. Step-by-step measures—such as seeking therapeutic support, focusing on small, manageable goals at work, and creating a structured daily routine—can help mitigate some of the emotional upheaval. The astrological indicators suggest that a pivot is imminent; though the pain is severe now, it also serves as a catalyst for renewal rather than total destruction.\n\nIn short, the universe is not orchestrating your downfall but is challenging you to transform your life. The data points to a critical period of inner clearing, with the potential for substantial positive change if you can navigate these difficult energies with care and support.","gen_started":"2025-02-06T12:23:21.722Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-06T12:23:32.090Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the chart and your heartfelt words, the key astrological indicators do not show that the universe intends for your life to be destroyed.
