Oh, I suppose that I don't deserve the decency and dignity of being treated like a human being? That's why I'm asking this of the cards. Because right now, I'm not getting the common decency from him of being treated like a human being who has feelings. He knows goddamn well how his silence hurts me. Because that was part of our conversation on Christmas Day. And I was crying because of it. He knows it hurts me. And he's using the silence as a control mechanism. And it's not fair to me. Sure, he said he's busy. I know his circumstances. I'm not an idiot. But at the same time, just like I said, I'm not an idiot. Nobody is that fucking busy. If I mean that much to him, the least he could do is treat me like I'm human.  He's in and out of WhatsApp all day long. I know this because I can see his status. The last seen timestamps. So he's communicating with everybody else in his life. He's got time for that. And if it's about privacy, well, he has to go piss. He lives in a house with three females. I'm pretty well sure he closes the door when he goes to piss. He could take five seconds to just send some kind of an acknowledgement. But I can't even get that. What am I truly worth to him? This is where I'm at. I'm tired of hurting and being put in this compartmentalization and being controlled. Because that's what he's doing. He's using his silence as a control mechanism. I don't deserve that. I mean, madam, this coming Friday, three days from now, I'm divorcing Edward. He and I are done as far as relationship goes. And we both have known this divorce date for over a month now. A week ago, when Edward was in Florida going on a cruise with his son, which by the way, Edward only gets to see his son once a year. And Edward is so busy, he had to take his work laptop with him to use the satellite connection and do work on a cruise while he's on PTO. And Edward still took a few seconds out of his time before the boat left the port to take pictures of the food he was eating and just share something with me. I still held enough value as a human being and as a friend to Edward. While he's supposed to be spending time with his son, he sent me a picture of his food just to share something. That's what's called human decency, how you treat friends. This is why I feel the way I do now. Because I'm not even getting that from Stefan. I'm being treated like I'm an object. And it's not fair to me. It's not fair for me to sit here crying all the time because I KNOW I'm getting treated that way. Yet he tells me how much I matter to him on Christmas day? When I realized that I had hurt him by making fun of his movie reference, I had the decency to treat Stefan like a human and apologize for it and try to correct it.  I don't even know what else to say about it, but that's where I'm at, and it hurts me tremendously. ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
