The Ascendant in Leo (Laura’s marker) receives a benefic influence from Jupiter sextile Ascendant (0° orb), suggesting an underlying strength or support. However, the presence of the Moon square Ascendant (0° orb) and Mercury opposition Ascendant (2° orb) indicate tension and disruption affecting bodily vitality. The Sun’s opposition to the Ascendant (5° orb) amplifies potential strain, while Chiron’s trine to the Ascendant (8° orb) offers a possibility for healing or remedy if attended to properly.\n\n2. The ruler of the Ascendant, the Sun (in Aquarius at 16°), forms several aspects. Its conjunction with Mercury (3° orb) and sextile with Chiron (3° orb) provides clarity about internal conditions and healing potential, yet the Sun’s square to the Moon (5° orb) and square to Uranus (7° orb) speak to unpredictable factors and internal disequilibrium that could manifest physically.\n\n3. Mars, placed in Cancer in the 12th house and retrograde, is in a tight square with Chiron (0° orb).
