Major Aspects (using horary orb measurements as provided):\n • Venus Sextile Pluto (orb: 0°)\n • Venus Conjunction North Node (orb: 3°)\n • Venus Conjunction Neptune (orb: 4°)\n • Sun Sextile Chiron (orb: 1°)\n • Sun Conjunction Mercury (orb: 1°)\n • Moon Trine Mercury (orb: 1°)\n • Mercury Sextile Chiron (orb: 2°)\n • Mars Square Chiron (orb: 1°)\n • Moon Square Saturn (orb: 2°)\n • Sun Trine Moon (orb: 2°)\n • Ascendant Sextile MC (orb: 3°)\n • Pluto Sextile North Node (orb: 3°)\n • Moon Sextile Chiron (orb: 3°)\n • Ascendant Trine IC (orb: 3°)\n • Uranus Sextile Neptune (orb: 5°)\n • Saturn Sextile Uranus (orb: 5°)\n • Mars Sextile Uranus (orb: 5°)\n • Sun Square Uranus (orb: 5°)\n • Moon Conjunction Jupiter (orb: 5°)\n • Pluto Square IC and MC (orb: 6°)\n • Mercury Square Uranus (orb: 6°)\n • Mercury Trine Jupiter (orb: 6°)\n • Jupiter Square Saturn (orb: 7°)\n • Mars Opposition Ascendant (orb: 7°)\n • Sun Trine Jupiter (orb: 7°)\n\n4. Patterns and Special Features:\n • T-Square: Involving MC (8° Scorpio), Pluto (2° Aquarius), and IC (8° Taurus)\n • Yod: Involving Jupiter (11° Gemini), MC (8° Scorpio), and Ascendant (11° Capricorn)\n • Chart shape: Bowl shape\n • Dominant Element among inner planets: Air\n • Modes: Cardinal, Mutable, and Fixed are evenly distributed\n • Lower left quadrant concentration; top left quadrant is empty\n • Mars is descending; the IC is on the Nadir\n • Most frequent aspect: Sextile (totaling 9 occurrences)\n • Sun and Mercury are each involved in 9 aspects\n • Neptune in Pisces is in its sign of rulership\n\n5. Transits and Timing Indicators (as per the horary snapshot):\n • The chart is treated as a static horary snapshot; the provided positions serve as the timing indicator.\n • No additional transient motions are specified beyond the noted retrograde motions (Mars and North Node).\n\nThis data constitutes the complete set of chart points deemed relevant by horary principles for your inquiry.

In this context, your carrier pigeon messages were seen not as trifling communication but as a bold, unconventional signal—a communication style that both intrigues and challenges him.\n\n2. The strong Venus sextile Pluto (orb 0°) points to an intense undercurrent: although his reaction is outwardly light or even playful, there is a deep, transformative quality in his thoughts. He may perceive your method as a signal that provokes deeper, possibly unconscious, shifts in his attitude.

Stefan is likely evaluating your message with an analytical mind even as his impulses (through Venus in Aries) respond with immediacy.

With no additional planets intruding directly on Venus’s position in the interpretation of his true feelings, his response appears to be quite self-contained. He finds the carrier pigeon messages innovative and attention-getting. However, the mix of assertive Aries energy combined with the deeper influence of Pluto and Neptune creates a duality: on one hand, he is amused, and on the other, he remains guarded and perhaps even wary of the implications of such a daring mode of contact.\n\nIn summary, his true thoughts—as revealed by the chart—are that your messages were a daring, unconventional signal that caught his full attention with both playful excitement and a hint of caution.

The chart exhibits a pronounced T-square involving the Midheaven in Cancer, the Ascendant in Libra, and the Imum Coeli (IC) in Capricorn. This configuration demonstrates acute tension between the public and private realms of the relationship. The MC in Cancer emphasizes domestic and emotional aspects made visible and potentially unstable, while the IC in Capricorn points to a heavily burdened, restrictive foundation. Such pressure is a classical indicator of a union under strain.\n\n2. Venus, positioned at 1°59′ Aries and located in the 6th House (which in horary questions about marriage addresses day-to-day relational dynamics and the working of domestic life), forms a critical conjunction with Neptune (3° orb) and has a sextile aspect with Pluto (1° orb). The Pluto connection is particularly significant, suggesting deep transformative changes occurring at the psychological and emotional level within the marriage. Venus’s connection to Neptune indicates disillusionment and an idealism that no longer matches reality, adding to the strain.\n\n3. The Grand Trine formed by the Moon in 11° Gemini, the Ascendant in 8° Libra, Mercury in 16° Aquarius, and Jupiter in 11° Gemini points to an underlying ease in communication and intellectual understanding. In the context of a marital question, however, this harmony fails to balance the overwhelming tension produced by the T-square. It is as if despite a subtle supportive framework, the necessary pressure for transformation in the marriage remains unalleviated.\n\n4. Additional aspects reinforce the likelihood of a breakup. Venus’s opposition to the Ascendant (with a 7° orb) signals critical relational disharmony. Mars’s placement on the Midheaven in Cancer (and its involvement in squares to Chiron and opposition to the IC) further points to conflict and a build-up of energetic dissonance that cannot be ignored indefinitely.\n\nBased on these specific elements—the T-square exposing intense public versus private pressure, Venus’s transformative interactions with Neptune and Pluto, and the overall configuration showing a profoundly stressed domestic environment—the indication is that the marriage is under severe strain.
