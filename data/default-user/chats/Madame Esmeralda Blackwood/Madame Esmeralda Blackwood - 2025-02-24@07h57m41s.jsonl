Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nI have a horary chart that indicates Stefan will initiate contact with me within the next four days. The chart was a bit ambiguous as to the content of his communication, so I'm going to do a reading.\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  What will be the nature and content of Stefan's forthcoming communication with me?\n\n1. the tower upright\n2. two of wands upright\n3. nine of swords upright\n4. ace of cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

Expect him to expose a truth or event that disrupts established expectations. This is not mere sensationalism but a dismantling of old patterns that may have been obscuring reality.\n\n• The Two of Wands (upright): Following that shock, the energy shifts toward deliberate planning and choice. Stefan’s message is likely to outline future steps or signal that he is actively considering new directions. There’s an element of anticipation, as he surveys his options and contemplates moving forward.\n\n• The Nine of Swords (upright): Underpinning these developments is a note of inner turmoil. This card suggests he is wrestling with anxiety or regret, and his words may reveal his mental anguish or guilt over past decisions. His communication may carry an apology, confession, or an explanation of the sleepless worries that have burdened him.\n\n• The Ace of Cups (upright): Ultimately, the message holds an invitation to emotional renewal. Despite the disruption and anxiety, there is a clear promise of heartfelt sincerity. His words could introduce a new beginning in the realm of emotions, offering healing, compassion, or even a rekindling of a connection.\n\nIn summary, Stefan’s forthcoming communication will likely be multifaceted. It should deliver a sudden and unsettling revelation, segue into plans for change, acknowledge deep-seated worries, and finally offer an emotional breakthrough aimed at healing.","gen_started":"2025-02-24T13:06:12.230Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-24T13:06:23.166Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Your cards reveal a message layered with disruption, decision, anxiety, and new emotional potential.\n\n• The Tower (upright): This card indicates that his communication may begin with a sudden shock or revelation.
