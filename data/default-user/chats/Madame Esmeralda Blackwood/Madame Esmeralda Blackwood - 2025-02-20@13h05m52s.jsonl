Mercury is at 11°33′ Pisces.\n C. Note the overlap: Both representatives fall into the mutable, watery realm of Pisces and are found within the stellium on the Midheaven (10th House: Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node).\n  • This conjunction emphasizes legal, public, and formal processes as key arenas for the matter.\n\nII. Key Aspects Affecting the Divorce Outcome\n A. Grand Square Involving MC (5° Pisces), IC (5° Virgo), Moon (2°33′ Sagittarius), and Jupiter (11°43′ Gemini)\n  • The polarities between public (MC) and private (IC) matter, with the emotional Moon square both angles (orb 3°), underscore severe tension affecting the marital dynamic.\n B. Stellium in Pisces on the MC (Mercury, Saturn, Sun, Neptune, North Node)\n  • This cluster reinforces the legal and formal dimension; Mercury and Saturn (Suzanne’s and Stefan’s representatives) are in aspect, albeit with a wide orb (Mercury–Saturn at orb ≈8°), indicating a complex but undeniable binding influence on the union.\n C. Mars in Cancer (retrograde, 17°05′)\n  • Mars is placed in the 1st House (appearance, personal drive) and trines Saturn (orb 2°), suggesting that despite painful challenges (further reinforced by Mars square Chiron, orb 3°), a turning point is building.\n D. The Moon’s character\n  • Positioned at 2°33′ Sagittarius and in its last-quarter phase, it signals that the issue is waning. The Moon’s aspects—sextile Pluto (orb 0°) and trine Venus (orb 7°)—point to transformative emotional shifts that, while painful, prepare the ground for a breakup.\n E. Additional tension indicators\n  • Mercury square Jupiter (orb 0°) reinforces communication clashes.\n  • Moon square MC and Moon square IC (orbs 3° each) highlight emotional discord manifesting in both public and private spheres.\n\nIII. Timing Considerations\n A. The Moon’s phase (last-quarter) traditionally indicates that the matter is in its final stages. In horary, the last-quarter Moon often suggests conclusions within one lunar cycle from chart initiation.\n B. The close clustering of key representatives in Pisces on the MC, a house related to legal affairs, implies that the legal processing (the filing of separation) is integral to the outcome.\n C. The cumulative pressure from the grand square, combined with the activations by Mars (though retrograde, it forms a trine to Saturn) and the transformative aspect of the Moon, signals an imminent decision.\n  • In horary practice, such configurations often resolve within approximately 35–45 days from the chart’s casting.\n\nIV. Synthesis of Findings\n • The representatives for both Stefan and Suzanne are deeply embedded in Pisces—a sign heavily linked to legal and dissolving matters—suggesting that the mechanism for divorce is both public (institutional) and emotional.\n • The clear tension between private (IC) and public (MC) matters, underscored by the grand square, indicates a painful yet determined process toward separation.\n • The last-quarter Moon sends a strong signal that the issue is now waning in positive marital energy, already pushing toward an endpoint.\n • The interrelation of Mercury (Suzanne) and Saturn (Stefan) in Pisces, despite their challenging configuration with additional harsh aspects (such as Mercury square Jupiter), further cements that the dissolution is legally and formally driven rather than a temporary quarrel.\n\nV.
