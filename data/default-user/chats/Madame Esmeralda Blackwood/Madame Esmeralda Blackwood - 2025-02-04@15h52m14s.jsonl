I will list only the relevant elements strictly from the horary chart provided and indicate how they relate under horary principles:\n\n1. Querent and Subject Indicators\n • Querent (Melissa): Represented by the Ascendant in Cancer at 22°54′.\n • Stefan (the subject of the divorce decision): Represented by the 9th house (per your instruction). According to your cross‐reference guide, the Ascendant’s 9th house in your chart corresponds to Stefan’s domain.\n\n2. House Details (as provided in the chart)\n • 1st House (Querent’s self): Begins in Cancer at 22°54′.\n • 9th House (Stefan’s representation): Begins at 6° Pisces.\n  – According to the provided house allocation, this house contains the following planets: Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node.\n\n3. Planetary Positions (as listed in the chart)\n • Sun in Aquarius at 16°17′\n • Moon in Taurus at 10°9′\n • Mercury in Aquarius at 12°54′\n • Venus at 0°23′ (noting that, by the house system provided, it falls in the 9th house)\n • Mars in Cancer at 19°24′ (retrograde)\n • Jupiter in Gemini at 11°16′\n • Saturn in Pisces at 17°50′ (in the 9th house)\n • Uranus in Taurus at 23°16′\n • Neptune in Pisces at 28°4′ (in the 9th house)\n • Pluto in Aquarius at 2°10′\n • North Node in Pisces at 29°39′ (retrograde, in the 9th house)\n • Chiron in Aries at 19°37′\n\n4. House Placements (using the provided house cusps)\n • 7th House: Begins at 22° Capricorn (contains Mercury and Pluto)\n • 8th House: Begins at 14° Aquarius (contains the Sun)\n • 9th House: Begins at 6° Pisces (contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node)\n • 10th House: Begins at 3° Aries (contains the Moon and Chiron)\n • 11th House: Begins at 13° Taurus (contains Jupiter and Uranus)\n • 12th House: Begins at 24° Gemini (contains Mars)\n\n5. Major Aspects (selected from the list, with an eye toward those most pertinent to decision-making and relational dynamics):\n • Neptune Conjunction North Node (orb 1°): Reinforces a blending of destiny and potential confusion in the area of Stefan’s affairs.\n • Venus Conjunction North Node (orb 1°) and Venus Conjunction Neptune (orb 2°): These indicate that matters of love/relationship are closely tied to fate—but also suggest an element of idealization or lack of clarity.\n • Mars Conjunction Ascendant (orb 3°): In the querent’s own chart, this highlights an assertive or emotionally charged presence that may influence the overall environment.\n • Saturn’s placement in the 9th house (with a close proximity to Venus and Neptune) introduces themes of structure, commitment, and potential delays or burdens related to the decision.\n • Additional supportive aspects include:\n  – Uranus Sextile Ascendant (orb 1°) – indicating sudden or unexpected influences affecting you.\n  – Saturn Trine Ascendant (orb 5°) – providing stability or seriousness in the personal sphere.\n\n6. Patterns and Chart Shapes\n • The chart is described as having a “Bowl shape,” with a dominance of Cardinal energy among the inner planets, suggesting an emphasis on decision-making and initiation or changes that require authority.\n • Multiple planet opposition between the MC (in Aries) and the IC (in Libra), along with the presence of several conjunctions around the North Node in Pisces, indicates tension between your inner personal life and external or fate-driven influences (which take on significance for Stefan’s decision).\n • The concentration of the subject’s indicators (the 9th house planets—Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node) means that their mutual aspects, dignities, and condition will be foremost in interpreting his decision.\n\n7. Timing and Modality\n • The fact that the 9th house is activated (with multiple factors within it) suggests that Stefan’s decision is not idle; it bears a mix of clarity (Venus), seriousness (Saturn), idealism/confusion (Neptune), and destiny (North Node).\n • The presence of dynamic aspects (e.g., Venus and Neptune’s conjunctions, Saturn’s placement) calls for a close look at the condition of these planets (their sign, dignity, and aspects to other key factors such as the Ascendant) to gauge decisiveness or ambivalence.\n\nThese are the primary chart data points to be used strictly under horary principles for interpretation in your query. When you are ready, please confirm or indicate any additional data—such as specific transit information at the time of the question—or provide any further instructions before I proceed with a full interpretation based on the above details.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T20:52:53.368Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T20:53:25.372Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a methodical listing of the chart data we’ll use for a horary analysis of your question.

Planetary Positions (as listed in the chart)\n • Sun in Aquarius at 16°17′\n • Moon in Taurus at 10°9′\n • Mercury in Aquarius at 12°54′\n • Venus at 0°23′ (noting that, by the house system provided, it falls in the 9th house)\n • Mars in Cancer at 19°24′ (retrograde)\n • Jupiter in Gemini at 11°16′\n • Saturn in Pisces at 17°50′ (in the 9th house)\n • Uranus in Taurus at 23°16′\n • Neptune in Pisces at 28°4′ (in the 9th house)\n • Pluto in Aquarius at 2°10′\n • North Node in Pisces at 29°39′ (retrograde, in the 9th house)\n • Chiron in Aries at 19°37′\n\n4. House Placements (using the provided house cusps)\n • 7th House: Begins at 22° Capricorn (contains Mercury and Pluto)\n • 8th House: Begins at 14° Aquarius (contains the Sun)\n • 9th House: Begins at 6° Pisces (contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node)\n • 10th House: Begins at 3° Aries (contains the Moon and Chiron)\n • 11th House: Begins at 13° Taurus (contains Jupiter and Uranus)\n • 12th House: Begins at 24° Gemini (contains Mars)\n\n5. Major Aspects (selected from the list, with an eye toward those most pertinent to decision-making and relational dynamics):\n • Neptune Conjunction North Node (orb 1°): Reinforces a blending of destiny and potential confusion in the area of Stefan’s affairs.\n • Venus Conjunction North Node (orb 1°) and Venus Conjunction Neptune (orb 2°): These indicate that matters of love/relationship are closely tied to fate—but also suggest an element of idealization or lack of clarity.\n • Mars Conjunction Ascendant (orb 3°): In the querent’s own chart, this highlights an assertive or emotionally charged presence that may influence the overall environment.\n • Saturn’s placement in the 9th house (with a close proximity to Venus and Neptune) introduces themes of structure, commitment, and potential delays or burdens related to the decision.\n • Additional supportive aspects include:\n  – Uranus Sextile Ascendant (orb 1°) – indicating sudden or unexpected influences affecting you.\n  – Saturn Trine Ascendant (orb 5°) – providing stability or seriousness in the personal sphere.\n\n6. Patterns and Chart Shapes\n • The chart is described as having a “Bowl shape,” with a dominance of Cardinal energy among the inner planets, suggesting an emphasis on decision-making and initiation or changes that require authority.\n • Multiple planet opposition between the MC (in Aries) and the IC (in Libra), along with the presence of several conjunctions around the North Node in Pisces, indicates tension between your inner personal life and external or fate-driven influences (which take on significance for Stefan’s decision).\n • The concentration of the subject’s indicators (the 9th house planets—Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node) means that their mutual aspects, dignities, and condition will be foremost in interpreting his decision.\n\n7. Timing and Modality\n • The fact that the 9th house is activated (with multiple factors within it) suggests that Stefan’s decision is not idle; it bears a mix of clarity (Venus), seriousness (Saturn), idealism/confusion (Neptune), and destiny (North Node).\n • The presence of dynamic aspects (e.g., Venus and Neptune’s conjunctions, Saturn’s placement) calls for a close look at the condition of these planets (their sign, dignity, and aspects to other key factors such as the Ascendant) to gauge decisiveness or ambivalence.\n\nThese are the primary chart data points to be used strictly under horary principles for interpretation in your query. When you are ready, please confirm or indicate any additional data—such as specific transit information at the time of the question—or provide any further instructions before I proceed with a full interpretation based on the above details."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 4, 2025 3:53pm","gen_started":"2025-02-04T20:52:53.368Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T20:53:25.372Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

Querent versus subject indicators: Your Ascendant in Cancer (22°54′) represents your emotional and personal involvement in the matter, while Stefan is indicated by the 9th house, which contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and the North Node. This cluster suggests that his area of decision is heavily influenced by factors of romance, duty, idealism, and destiny.\n\n2. The 9th house cluster:\n • Venus in Aries at 0°23′ points to issues of love and relational attraction. In this context it brings a slight impulsiveness or desire for a change, yet its conjunction to the North Node indicates that these impulses are bound up in fate.\n • Saturn in Pisces at 17°50′ stands for duty, structure, and responsibility. Its presence in the 9th house suggests that despite any emotional turbulence, there is a serious, perhaps reluctant, commitment operating within Stefan.\n • Neptune in Pisces at 28°4′ represents confusion and idealism. It tends to blur the clarity of his decision-making, adding layers of uncertainty regarding his true intentions.\n • The North Node in Pisces at 29°39′, retrograde, underlines a fated quality to his circumstances. Its linkage with Venus reinforces that deeper destinies are at play, though not necessarily leading to radical change.\n\n3. Supporting aspects and configurations:\n • The conjunction of Venus with the North Node and Neptune implies that any decision made by Stefan is not solely rational; it is imbued with elements of destiny and romantic idealization that may not be fully clear in intent. This ambiguous combination is common when personal desires are entangled with a sense of duty or obligation.\n • Saturn’s influence in the subject’s domain emphasizes restraint and the weight of responsibility. In horary matters, such an influence often suggests a decision leaning toward the status quo, even if it is made reluctantly.\n • A Mars on your Ascendant (with its assertive, passionate quality) indicates that your side of the matter is energetic and emotionally charged. This energy contrasts with the more measured and complicated forces influencing Stefan’s decision-making process. It reinforces that the central tension exists between the desire for change and forces that tether him to duty.\n\n4. Interpretation of the decision regarding divorce:\n • The potent influence of Saturn in the 9th house points to a decision that favors maintaining commitment rather than pursuing a disruptive change—divorce. The seriousness and restraint of Saturn overcomes the impulsiveness of Venus.\n • The overlay of Neptune’s diffuse energy and the North Node’s fated pull prevents a clear-cut, impulsive decision. It appears that while the potential for change exists, the prevailing forces signal that Stefan has, at a fundamental level, resolved not to initiate divorce. His decision is wrapped in responsibilities and a weighty sense of duty rather than a clear embrace of separation.\n • The chart does not show an unequivocal trigger for radical change in his affairs. Instead, it points to an internal struggle where idealistic or escapist notions are held in check by a heavier awareness of marital obligations.\n\nBased on these elements, the indication is that Stefan has made a decision regarding the matter. The decision leans toward not filing for divorce, driven by a serious, duty-bound perspective despite underlying emotional or romantic uncertainties. All indicators suggest that although the internal conflict remains complex, the chosen course is to continue the union rather than dissolve it.\n\nIf further data or clarification concerning transits or evolving aspects become available, a subsequent review might reveal additional nuances.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T20:53:41.468Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T20:53:58.377Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the horary chart, the details indicate the following:\n\n1.
