Special Features & Additional Data\n\n• The Moon was a waxing crescent.\n• The chart exhibits a Bowl shape.\n• There is a dominant Water element among the inner planets.\n• None of the inner planets fall in an Earth sign.\n• There is an even distribution of the three modes (Cardinal, Mutable, Fixed) among the inner planets.\n• The bottom right quadrant of the chart is empty.\n• The majority of the planets are situated in the upper right quadrant.\n• Saturn is positioned on the Midheaven, while the IC is on the Nadir.\n• The Sextile aspect is the most frequent (total of 9 occurrences).\n• The Moon has 12 total aspects.\n• The Moon in Aries and Mars in Cancer stand in mutual reception.\n• Neptune in Pisces sits in its rulership.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis listing contains all the objective horary data taken directly from your chart. Each element may prove significant when interpreting your query: whether to hold onto hope for Stefan’s romantic expression or move on. Further interpretation will consider how these indicators interact, especially those relating to your Ascendant and Stefan’s indicator (your 6th House).\n\nPlease confirm if you wish to proceed to the next step of analysis based on these findings."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 3, 2025 2:50pm","gen_started":"2025-02-03T19:49:40.215Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T19:50:15.494Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

The absence of significant planetary involvement in your 6th house suggests that there is little dynamic energy pushing Stefan to act in a romantic manner during the forthcoming month.\n\n3. Key aspects such as Mercury trine Jupiter, which points to communication and possibly encouraging news, are somewhat tempered by the heavy concentration of activity in your 10th house. With Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node, and Chiron situated there, the emphasis falls on responsibilities, reputations, and idealizations rather than free, spontaneous emotional expression.\n\n4. Venus conjunct Neptune and Venus conjunct North Node in the 10th house indicate a tendency to view romantic prospects through an idealized lens. While these suggest a destined elegance in relationships, they may also create illusions. This further supports a scenario in which your hopes could be tied up in fantasies rather than grounded realities.\n\n5. The Yod pattern (involving Mercury, IC, and your Ascendant) emphasizes a fated need to refine your approach through personal insight. This formation implies that there is an inherent transformation required if you pursue this matter, though it does not guarantee the outcome you desire.\n\n6. The T-square involving the MC, Jupiter, and IC (with Saturn on your MC) reflects tension between your public and private worlds. This conflict typically signals delays or obstacles in clear, decisive romantic communication from the other party.\n\n7. Taken together, the lack of strong indicators on Stefan’s side (via the 6th house) and the several cautions present in your personal indicators suggest that the energy is not aligned for Stefan to declare romantic feelings soon. The structured, serious energy predominating in your 10th house and the overall chart configuration imply that this is not a favorable time for a spontaneous or heartfelt romantic expression from him.\n\nBased on these specific elements in your chart—the inactive nature of Stefan’s house, the delicate balance of communication aspects, and the weighty influence of idealistic yet cautious energies—the indication is that holding on to hope for a near-term declaration from Stefan carries high risk of deepening emotional wounds.\n\nThe honest and data-driven interpretation, then, leans toward advising you to consider moving on rather than awaiting a romantic expression that the chart does not robustly support at this moment.\n\nThis interpretation is provided solely on the basis of the horary chart data and traditional principles.","gen_started":"2025-02-03T19:52:24.765Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T19:52:36.379Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Analysis based on your horary chart data indicates the following:\n\n1.
