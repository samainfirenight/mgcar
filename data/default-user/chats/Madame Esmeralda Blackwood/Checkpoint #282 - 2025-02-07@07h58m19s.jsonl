Question Framework and Representation\n • Query: “When will Stefan make his final decision about his marriage, or has he already done so?”\n • Representation:\n  – Melissa is represented by the Ascendant (1st house)\n  – Stefan is represented by the Ascendant’s 9th house; with no planets in that house, his primary indicator is Mars (the house ruler)\n\n2. Planetary Positions (with degree, sign, and house placement as provided)\n • Sun: 18°57′ Aquarius – located in the 1st House\n • Moon: 16°51′ Gemini – located in the 5th House\n • Mercury: 17°27′ Aquarius – located in the 1st House\n • Venus: 2°15′ Aries – located in the 2nd House\n • Mars: 18°47′ Cancer (retrograde) – located in the 6th House (Stefan’s representative)\n • Jupiter: 11°17′ Gemini – located in the 4th House\n • Saturn: 18°08′ Pisces – located in the 1st House\n • Uranus: 23°17′ Taurus – located in the 3rd House\n • Neptune: 28°09′ Pisces – located in the 2nd House\n • Pluto: 2°15′ Aquarius – located in the 12th House\n • North Node: 29°30′ Pisces – located in the 2nd House\n • Chiron: 19°42′ Aries – located in the 2nd House\n\n3. House Structure (as provided)\n • 1st House (Ascendant): Starts at 3° Aquarius; contains Sun, Mercury, Saturn\n • 2nd House: Starts at 20° Pisces; contains Venus, Neptune, North Node, Chiron\n • 3rd House: Starts at 2° Taurus; contains Uranus\n • 4th House: Starts at 26° Taurus; contains Jupiter\n • 5th House: Starts at 14° Gemini; contains Moon\n • 6th House: Starts at 3° Cancer; contains Mars\n • 7th House: Starts at 3° Leo\n • 8th House: Starts at 20° Virgo\n • 9th House: Starts at 2° Scorpio\n • 10th House (MC): Starts at 26° Scorpio\n • 11th House: Starts at 14° Sagittarius\n • 12th House: Starts at 3° Capricorn; contains Pluto\n\n • Note on Representation: By the provided cross-reference, Ascendant’s 9th house corresponds to Stefan’s 12th house. With the 9th house being empty, Mars – as the ruling planet for that house – is taken as his key significator\n\n4. Major Aspects (selected by horary relevance and order of significance)\n • Mars trine Saturn, orb 0°         – Indicates a stabilizing, decision-affirming influence involving Stefan’s representative\n • Mars square Chiron, orb 1°         – Suggests potential for hurt, delay, or internal conflict\n • Sun sextile Chiron, orb 1°         – Points to healing insights emerging from core identity\n • Moon trine Mercury, orb 1°         – Fosters communication and intuition\n • Pluto conjunction Ascendant, orb 1°     – Demands transformative change influencing Melissa’s perspective\n • Venus sextile Pluto, orb 0°         – Hints at hidden or transformative influences in relationship matters\n • Sun conjunction Mercury, orb 1°       – Merges thought and identity in the reading\n • Additional minor aspects (with orbs noted ranging 2°–8°) include:\n  – Moon square Saturn (2°)\n  – Mercury sextile Chiron (2°)\n  – Neptune sextile IC (2°)\n  – Neptune trine MC (2°)\n  – Sun trine Moon (2°)\n\n5. Configurational Patterns and Special Features\n • Grand Trine Pattern: Involving Mars (Cancer, 6th House), MC (Scorpio, 10th House), and Saturn (Pisces, in the 1st House)\n • Kite Pattern: Combining Mars, MC, Saturn and the influence of Uranus (Taurus, 3rd House)\n • Cradle Pattern: Involving MC, IC, North Node, Pluto, and Venus – indicating deeper transformational themes\n • Special Features:\n  – The chart is described as a Bowl shape with the Air element dominant among the inner planets\n  – Fixed mode is dominant among inner planets\n  – Pluto appears as a rising factor, and Uranus along with the IC are on the Nadir\n  – Sextile aspects occur frequently (15 instances in total)\n\nThis compilation represents all chart data relevant for a strict horary analysis of your inquiry.

Question Framework and Representation\n • Query: “When will Stefan make his final decision about his marriage, or has he already done so?”\n • Representation:\n  – Melissa is represented by the Ascendant (1st house)\n  – Stefan is represented by the Ascendant’s 9th house; with no planets in that house, his primary indicator is Mars (the house ruler)\n\n2. Planetary Positions (with degree, sign, and house placement as provided)\n • Sun: 18°57′ Aquarius – located in the 1st House\n • Moon: 16°51′ Gemini – located in the 5th House\n • Mercury: 17°27′ Aquarius – located in the 1st House\n • Venus: 2°15′ Aries – located in the 2nd House\n • Mars: 18°47′ Cancer (retrograde) – located in the 6th House (Stefan’s representative)\n • Jupiter: 11°17′ Gemini – located in the 4th House\n • Saturn: 18°08′ Pisces – located in the 1st House\n • Uranus: 23°17′ Taurus – located in the 3rd House\n • Neptune: 28°09′ Pisces – located in the 2nd House\n • Pluto: 2°15′ Aquarius – located in the 12th House\n • North Node: 29°30′ Pisces – located in the 2nd House\n • Chiron: 19°42′ Aries – located in the 2nd House\n\n3. House Structure (as provided)\n • 1st House (Ascendant): Starts at 3° Aquarius; contains Sun, Mercury, Saturn\n • 2nd House: Starts at 20° Pisces; contains Venus, Neptune, North Node, Chiron\n • 3rd House: Starts at 2° Taurus; contains Uranus\n • 4th House: Starts at 26° Taurus; contains Jupiter\n • 5th House: Starts at 14° Gemini; contains Moon\n • 6th House: Starts at 3° Cancer; contains Mars\n • 7th House: Starts at 3° Leo\n • 8th House: Starts at 20° Virgo\n • 9th House: Starts at 2° Scorpio\n • 10th House (MC): Starts at 26° Scorpio\n • 11th House: Starts at 14° Sagittarius\n • 12th House: Starts at 3° Capricorn; contains Pluto\n\n • Note on Representation: By the provided cross-reference, Ascendant’s 9th house corresponds to Stefan’s 12th house. With the 9th house being empty, Mars – as the ruling planet for that house – is taken as his key significator\n\n4.

Stefan’s representation is taken from Mars in the 6th house. Note that Mars is retrograde in Cancer, which in horary work signals internal delays and a review of strong passions or conflicts.\n\n2. The configuration Mars trine Saturn (orb 0°) indicates that, once discipline and resolution have had their due course, a decisive action will emerge. Saturn’s stabilizing influence suggests that a definitive decision is on the horizon when internal structures become realigned.\n\n3. However, the square between Mars and Chiron (orb 1°) reveals that deep-seated wounds or a sense of vulnerability are actively interfering. This aspect points to an internal conflict—hurt that must be acknowledged and healed—before Stefan can fully commit.\n\n4. Supporting energies come from the Moon trine Mercury and Sun sextile Chiron, indicating that intuitive communication and healing insights are available, though they do not yet dispel the hesitancy evidenced by Mars’s retrograde motion.\n\n5. Venus sextile Pluto (orb 0°) and Pluto’s conjunction with the Ascendant further hint at transformative undercurrents in relationship dynamics. Such energies imply that both parties are subject to a deep shift, which may catalyze the decision once the personal transformation reaches a critical point.\n\n6. Collectively, the planetary patterns (including the Grand Trine involving Mars, Saturn, and the MC, and the additional supportive configurations) indicate that while a final decision process is underway, unresolved emotional conflicts are impeding a swift conclusion. Stefan’s decision is not final yet; it is pending the resolution of his internal struggles and the stabilization of his internal commitments.\n\nBased on these elements, the indication is that Stefan has not fully made his final decision about his marriage. The Martian energy, along with supportive transits from Saturn, suggests that as soon as he heals the wounds indicated by Chiron, his choice will crystallize. The timeline depends on the progression of these healing and restructuring processes.\n\nPlease advise if you require further clarification on any specific aspect of the reading.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T12:59:14.605Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T12:59:26.787Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Analyzing the horary chart with strict horary principles, we observe the following:\n\n1.
