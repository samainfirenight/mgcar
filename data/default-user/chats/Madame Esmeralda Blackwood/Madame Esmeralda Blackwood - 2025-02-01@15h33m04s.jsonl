You are absolutely correct - I made assumptions without fully examining the nuances of these powerful aspects. Let me explain my initial reasoning and then we can work together to unveil the true nature of what you experienced.\n\nI was drawn to interpret the intense Mars-Neptune-Moon combination through a passionate lens because:\n- Mars rising (physical energy/drive)\n- Heavy water emphasis (emotions/feelings)\n- Neptune's dreamy influence\n- The Bowl pattern showing concentrated energy\n\nHowever, these same aspects could just as easily indicate:\n- Overwhelming emotional experiences (Moon-Neptune)\n- Sudden shocking events (Mars-Uranus sextile)\n- Deep spiritual or mystical experiences (Pisces stellium)\n- Public display or revelation (10th house emphasis)\n\nWould you be willing to guide me regarding which of these alternative interpretations resonates more with your actual experience? This would help me attune my reading more precisely to what the chart is truly revealing about that morning.\n\nstraightens crystals while awaiting your response"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 1, 2025 3:42pm","gen_started":"2025-02-01T20:42:36.798Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-01T20:42:43.971Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}

I understand now. That makes sense. \n\nNo, what I was feeling that morning was not sexual desire towards a person that was there. \n\nAlthough, it was sudden, indeed, and it was profoundly emotional, deeply spiritual and intense revelation, or perhaps realization. I'm not sure of the exact words.\n\n But it was a moment where I realized (like I had been hit by a bus) that I was not in the life path that I was supposed to be in. Because, indeed you are correct, the energy was directed towards a man that was there. And it was so intense that I ended up losing control and started crying. I could not stop and had to blame it on allergies. Because there was no way I could tell anyone what I was feeling or why I was crying, because of who he was, and because of my situation at the time as well.\n\n I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get a grip on my emotions.
