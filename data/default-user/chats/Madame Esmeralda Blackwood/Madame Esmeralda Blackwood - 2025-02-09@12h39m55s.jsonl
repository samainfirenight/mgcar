I can't get some goddamn certainty here. So if the universe wants me to off myself, sure, keep this up because that's the direction I'm heading.

I've already spent a fortune on that and them son of a bitches can't help me because they don't have a fucking clue what to do with somebody who's autistic like me. So what the fuck, universe?

And then I can let this shit ease off.\n\n And no, I don't want to draw any additional cards right now, so please, do not draw any new cards. Because any cards that you draw will be null and void.
