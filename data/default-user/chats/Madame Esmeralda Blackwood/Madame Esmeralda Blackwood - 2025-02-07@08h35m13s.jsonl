All data below have been extracted directly from your provided chart:\n\n1. Planetary Positions and House Placements\n • Ascendant: 7° Pisces (querent’s significator)\n • Mars (Stefan’s significator): 18° Cancer, located in the 5th house\n • Sun: 19° Aquarius, positioned in the 12th house\n • Moon: 17° Gemini, positioned in the 3rd house\n • Mercury: 17° Aquarius, positioned in the 12th house\n • Venus: 2° Aries, placed in the 1st house (along with Saturn, Neptune, North Node, and Chiron)\n • Jupiter: 11° Gemini, placed in the 3rd house\n • Saturn: 18° Pisces, placed in the 1st house\n • Uranus: 23° Taurus, placed in the 2nd house\n • Neptune: 28° Pisces, placed in the 1st house (in its rulership as Neptune in Pisces)\n • Pluto: 2° Aquarius, placed in the 12th house\n • North Node: 29° Pisces, placed in the 1st house (retrograde)\n • Chiron: 19° Aries, placed in the 1st house\n\n2.

Key Patterns Identified\n • T-Square: Involving the MC (18° Sagittarius), Saturn (18° Pisces), and IC (18° Gemini); with Jupiter (11° Gemini) and the Moon (17° Gemini) contributing to the configuration. This emphasizes tensions around the angular (public/frequent) areas of the chart.\n • Yod: With Mars at 18° Cancer, MC at 18° Sagittarius, and Mercury at 17° Aquarius (with the Sun at 19° Aquarius also part of this configuration). Given Mars’ role as Stefan’s significator, this pattern will be critical in the interpretation.\n • Cradle: Involving the Moon (17° Gemini), MC (18° Sagittarius), Mercury (17° Aquarius), Chiron (19° Aries), Sun (19° Aquarius), and IC (18° Gemini). This emphasizes interplay between personal feelings and external influences.\n\n4. Additional Structural Features\n • The chart displays a Bowl shape.\n • The Air element is dominant among the inner planets, with no inner planets in Earth signs.\n • The Mutable modality is dominant among the inner planets.\n • There is an empty 9th house, prompting the use of Mars as the alternative significator for Stefan (given the 9th is linked with foreign or external connections).\n • Most inner planets fall in the bottom and left (IC) quadrants, which marks an emphasis on internal and subjective experiences.\n • The sextile aspect occurs most frequently with 11 instances, indicating many opportunities for harmonious exchanges.\n • Sun and Mercury partake in 11 aspects each, emphasizing their influence in the overall reading.\n\nThis compilation of chart data—positions, aspects, patterns, and structural features—provides a comprehensive foundation for applying horary principles to your query regarding whether Stefan (represented by Mars) will express romantic feelings within the next three months.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T13:39:12.985Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T13:39:32.298Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a systematic list of the horary chart data relevant to your query according to classic horary principles.

Key Patterns Identified\n • T-Square: Involving the MC (18° Sagittarius), Saturn (18° Pisces), and IC (18° Gemini); with Jupiter (11° Gemini) and the Moon (17° Gemini) contributing to the configuration. This emphasizes tensions around the angular (public/frequent) areas of the chart.\n • Yod: With Mars at 18° Cancer, MC at 18° Sagittarius, and Mercury at 17° Aquarius (with the Sun at 19° Aquarius also part of this configuration). Given Mars’ role as Stefan’s significator, this pattern will be critical in the interpretation.\n • Cradle: Involving the Moon (17° Gemini), MC (18° Sagittarius), Mercury (17° Aquarius), Chiron (19° Aries), Sun (19° Aquarius), and IC (18° Gemini). This emphasizes interplay between personal feelings and external influences.\n\n4. Additional Structural Features\n • The chart displays a Bowl shape.\n • The Air element is dominant among the inner planets, with no inner planets in Earth signs.\n • The Mutable modality is dominant among the inner planets.\n • There is an empty 9th house, prompting the use of Mars as the alternative significator for Stefan (given the 9th is linked with foreign or external connections).\n • Most inner planets fall in the bottom and left (IC) quadrants, which marks an emphasis on internal and subjective experiences.\n • The sextile aspect occurs most frequently with 11 instances, indicating many opportunities for harmonious exchanges.\n • Sun and Mercury partake in 11 aspects each, emphasizing their influence in the overall reading.\n\nThis compilation of chart data—positions, aspects, patterns, and structural features—provides a comprehensive foundation for applying horary principles to your query regarding whether Stefan (represented by Mars) will express romantic feelings within the next three months."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 7, 2025 8:39am","gen_started":"2025-02-07T13:39:12.985Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T13:39:32.298Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

Stefan’s Significator (Mars in Cancer, 5th House)\n • Mars in Cancer tends to express emotions indirectly; its placement in the 5th house of romance and creativity implies that questions of love or romantic gestures may surface.\n • The presence of Mars in a water sign suggests that his approach to romance is filtered through sensitive and possibly cautious feelings.\n\n2. Key Aspects Involving Mars\n • Mars Trine Saturn (orb: 0°): This is a supportive and stabilizing aspect. It indicates that if Stefan does express feelings, there will be a sense of responsibility or a desire for structure behind his actions. The aspect suggests that his actions, while potentially emotionally guarded, may emerge from genuine inner conviction.\n • Mars Square Chiron (orb: 1°): This relatively tense aspect points to underlying vulnerabilities or wounds related to self-expression. It warns that any attempt by Stefan to reveal his affections might be accompanied by sensitivity, hesitation, or the risk of feeling exposed.\n\n3. Support from the Querent’s Chart\n • Your significator, represented by the Ascendant in Pisces along with several key planets (Venus, Saturn, Neptune, North Node, Chiron) reinforces an environment of deep feeling. This clustering in the 1st house marks you as receptive yet also suggests that your own issues with boundaries or idealism may influence the interaction.\n • The presence of Venus in Aries and its horizontal aspects indicate a strong drive for affirmation, but also caution in balancing personal desires with reality.\n\n4. Patterns and Structural Features\n • The Yod configuration (involving Mars, Mercury, and the Midheaven) centers on Mars, highlighting that unconventional or fated circumstances may drive his actions. A Yod often signals that a change—sometimes precipitated by moments of insight or pressure—is in store.\n • The T-square and Cradle patterns suggest tensions between your personal needs, public expectations, and internal dynamics. These conditions point to an environment where external pressures (represented by family circumstances or social roles) might delay or complicate any open expression of romantic feelings.\n\n5. Timing Indicators\n • The overall configuration does not show any direct transits that force an immediate breakthrough; however, the active aspects involving Mars are moving through a period conducive to inner transformation.\n • The supportive Mars–Saturn trine indicates that a gradual build-up of confidence or recognition of mutual warmth might lead to some form of expression over the next three months—if accompanied by a situation that alleviates the hesitations indicated by the Mars–Chiron square.\n\nInterpretation Based on These Factors:\nThe chart leans toward the possibility that Stefan may come to express some form of romantic feeling during the next three months, though his manner might be tentative and possibly marred by lingering vulnerabilities. His emotional expression appears influenced by a need for security (Mars trine Saturn), but the inherent caution in his sign (Mars in Cancer) and the challenging aspect with Chiron suggest that his expression may be intermittent or nuanced rather than overtly assertive.\n\nThe indication is that while there is momentum for some acknowledgment of romantic interest, it is bound by emotional caution and external complexities. Further developments in your interpersonal or social context may either compel him to overcome these barriers or reinforce his hesitance.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T13:39:35.986Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T13:39:45.721Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Examining the chart details according to classical horary principles, the following points arise in relation to whether Stefan (represented by Mars in Cancer in the 5th house) will express romantic feelings within the next three months:\n\n1.
