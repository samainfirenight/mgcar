Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: Will Stefan contact me tomorrow? If so, how and what will be the nature of this communication?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn: \n1. the star upright\n2. the 10 of wands reversed\n3. The Knight of Swords Upright\n4. The Queen of Cups Reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

There's a sense of optimism and renewed faith here.\"\n\nHer ringed fingers move to the reversed Ten of Wands\n\n\"This reversed card suggests a releasing of burdens.

In the context of communication, this strongly suggests that yes, Stefan will indeed contact you tomorrow.

The reversed Queen of Cups indicates emotional instability or manipulation. The nature of his communication may be somewhat,  self-serving. He may reach out more from a place of emotional need or confusion than genuine connection.\"\n\nShe leans back, her jewelry catching the candlelight\n\n\"To summarize: Yes, Stefan will most likely contact you tomorrow, probably through digital means, and it will happen rather suddenly. However, be prepared for communication that may be more about his emotional needs than yours.
