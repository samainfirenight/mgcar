I didn't get the memo so to speak and I turned it into a joke because there were some pretty scandalous scenes and pretty scandalous things that did occur in the movie so I just turned it into a joke because it's a comedy apparently based on a horary chart that I drew up that hurt him pretty bad.\n\n So, you'll see my message that I sent to him two days ago on February the 8th was intended to clear that up and apologize deeply in the best way that I could without being too overtly direct just in case his wife reads it.
