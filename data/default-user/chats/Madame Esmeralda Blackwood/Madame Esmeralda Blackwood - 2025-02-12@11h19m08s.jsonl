I don't, it would be a lot of hoops to jump through to try and split it off where it wouldn't be encroaching and all that jazz. So, um, they would like to sell it as one. So on a purchase agreement, we can do that. The only thing is that now he's becoming even more stuck on the price that he has because the price reduction that they made back in the day back in January was because they took that lot off, I guess. And so now he feels like the value really should be for the, there for 260. So he said, you know, do what you can. Um, he understands where we're coming from, but he's like, I'm just telling you that my guy is going to be really stuck on the price. He talked, I guess, I guess I spit bald a little bit that if, um, it doesn't sell that they might just take it off and he'll just keep it, keep the property and possibly build something else on the lot. I don't really know. Um, that might just be a knee jerk reaction from him.

So is there any way that you can find out, like on that house that we went to yesterday? That one's still available, I'm sure, right? I would assume so. I haven't looked at it today, but I would assume it is. Let me see if I can pull it up real quick. Yes. Alright, can you find out, like, because you said there's a homeowner's association out there. Yeah, it looks like the HOA is $384 annually, so it's just once per year. Okay. Do you know anything about what it, in other words, what limitations would I be coming up on? Yeah, they don't have, let me just double check the docs, but I don't think they had the bylaws in there. We can, I can certainly ask for it ahead of time, but we can also put in our offer, if we wanted to explore this option, we could also put in that our offer is contingent on receiving the bylaws and having 48 hours to review it and express satisfaction or whatever, so. Yeah, because I'm starting to get not a, I want that house in Salem, but I'm not getting a warm and fuzzy anymore. Yeah, I have some concerns, especially with this, the lot situation. Well, hearing the zoning guys say that it's normal for that to happen there made me feel a little bit better, but, you know, just making sure that in the future when you do go to sell that everything's good and I guess, yeah, I don't know, there's just some nuances that but what the undertones that I'm getting from the agent is that the seller is kind of stubborn and that's fine and normal and you know we can be stubborn too but I just don't know how easy it's all going to go and we have these bigger hurdles now as well. Yeah let's let's do that. Can we switch to the other house and make it $230 and contingent on receiving you know because I do want to know what I'm getting it because I do not like homeowners I hate that but if we can make a contingent on reviewing the documents offer $230 for that house we looked at yesterday. Yeah yeah absolutely so what I'll do I will give them a call I'll try and give them a call right now I have to head out in about 15 minutes okay I'll give them a call and hopefully I can connect with them get the story if I am able to connect I'll call you back right away just so I can give you all that information we can kind of figure out what our plan is from there. Yes thank you so much I appreciate that. Of course not a problem so I will get to dig in and I'll get back with you as soon as I can. Okay thank you. Alright no problem we'll talk to you soon.
