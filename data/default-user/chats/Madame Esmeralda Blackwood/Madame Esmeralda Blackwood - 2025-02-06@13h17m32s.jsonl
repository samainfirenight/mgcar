Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Will Stefan decide, or has already decided, to file for divorce from Suzanne between now and March 15th, 2025?\n\n1.

With one card reversed and one upright, we are indeed looking at an 'Uncertain' reading. However, let me explain why the Universe shows this uncertainty, \"\n\nShe gestures to the Nine of Cups reversed\n\n\"The Nine of Cups reversed suggests deep dissatisfaction and unfulfilled wishes. In Stefan's case, this indicates he's extremely unhappy in the marriage. There's a sense of emotional emptiness and disappointment. The card also hints at overindulgence - perhaps one or both parties have been trying to fill their emotional void with material things or other distractions.\"\n\nHer hand moves to the Seven of Pentacles upright\n\n\"The Seven of Pentacles upright is fascinating in this context. This card represents assessment, patience, and long-term rewards. Stefan is definitely evaluating his investment in this marriage. He's looking at what he's put in and what he's gotten out.
