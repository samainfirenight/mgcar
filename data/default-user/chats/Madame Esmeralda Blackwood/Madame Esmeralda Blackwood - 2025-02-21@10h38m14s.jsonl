It indicates that there are significant inner fears or worries present—either on your part or reflected in Stefan’s state. It sets a tone of overthinking and possibly sleepless distress, suggesting that critical decisions are being marred by internal torment.\n\n• The Hermit (reversed): In this position, the Hermit reversed speaks to an avoidance of deep reflection. It may point to Stefan’s unwillingness or inability to engage in personal introspection about his feelings or the requirements of a potential romance. The reversed energy implies clinging to external distractions rather than seeking inner clarity, leaving unresolved issues in his emotional life.\n\n• Two of Swords (reversed): This card usually signals a lifting of stalemate—choices are forced when indecision is resolved in a hasty or uncomfortable manner. The reversal indicates that any avoidance of decision-making is now coming to a head, but not in a balanced or thoughtful way. Instead, it suggests that the decision regarding the connection is emerging from conflict rather than a calm, honest evaluation.\n\n• Five of Swords (upright): The appearance of the Five of Swords points to conflict, tension, and a win-at-all-costs attitude. This energy implies that the dynamics may be marked by strife or hurtful exchanges. It warns that if Stefan enters into this romantic possibility, it could be underlined by dispute or a sense of defeat, perhaps stemming from unresolved internal battles and miscommunication.\n\n• Knight of Swords (reversed): Normally a card associated with assertive, swift action in pursuit of truth, its reversal demonstrates misdirected energy. Stefan may be prone to impulsiveness or reckless communication, but in this case, the energy is fragmented and disorganized rather than constructive. This disorder in his approach to decisions could further hinder any genuine, thoughtful exploration of romance.\n\n• Ten of Coins (reversed): This final card relates to long-term stability and security, especially in matters involving families or established commitments. When reversed, it suggests that the prospect of creating a lasting, secure relationship is seriously compromised. In the context of your question, it indicates that any romantic connection explored under these circumstances may lack the foundation for consistency and enduring commitment.\n\nIn summary, the reading suggests that Stefan is currently steeped in anxiety, avoidance of self-reflection, and internal conflict. His decision-making about romantic matters seems to be emerging from a state of unresolved strife rather than a balanced, heartfelt desire. There is an indication that any connection might be marred by impulsiveness, miscommunication, and instability rather than a clear and sincere pursuit of romance.\n\nConfidence level: Moderate. The cards indicate considerable obstacles in his emotional readiness for a true romantic exploration at this time.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T15:45:16.417Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T15:45:36.055Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa, based on the sequence of cards drawn regarding your query about Stefan’s willingness to explore a romantic connection, here is an analysis:\n\n• Nine of Swords (upright): This card emphasizes anxiety and mental distress.
