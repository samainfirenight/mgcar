Does the chart give that?\n\n So let me be honest, I have my own plans coming to fruition in my own life, and I've got a short window of time to make a decision on buying a house. And I know that things are coming to play for Stefan. And for me to contact him right now would not be advisable. So I'm seeking guidance from the heavens. That way I know if I should plan in my house purchasing for a larger family than what I currently have.\n\n I already have my pre-approval letters from lenders, so I need to make this decision before he (Stefan) will be ready to contact me.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
