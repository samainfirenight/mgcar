In this chart Suzanne is represented by the Ascendant at 24° Aries. The factors below are noted for further interpretation:\n\n1. Core Identity and Personal Indicators (Suzanne):\n • Ascendant in 24° Aries (Suzanne’s persona in this event)\n • Chiron is conjunct the Ascendant (orb of 2°), indicating personal vulnerability or a wound that may be influencing her actions\n • Venus opposes the Ascendant (orb 3°), which may point to relationship or appearance-related tensions\n\n2. Key Planetary Positions:\n • Sun in 28° Virgo\n • Moon in 5° Taurus (waning gibbous phase)\n • Mercury in 19° Virgo\n • Venus in 27° Libra (in its own sign, suggesting strength in partnership dynamics but also potential conflicts in power issues as seen later)\n • Mars in 9° Cancer (located on the Nadir and in the 3rd House, linking it to home or domestic issues)\n • Jupiter in 20° Gemini\n • Saturn in 15° Pisces (retrograde)\n • Uranus in 27° Taurus (retrograde)\n • Neptune in 28° Pisces (retrograde)\n • Pluto in 29° Capricorn (retrograde)\n • North Node in 6° Aries (retrograde)\n • Chiron in 22° Aries (retrograde)\n\n3. House Emphasis and Significant Placements:\n • 1st House (Suzanne’s immediate persona) in Aries includes the Moon and Uranus, emphasizing personal mood and sudden shifts or disruptions\n • 3rd House in Gemini holds Mars, which touches on short-term, immediate actions or local environment factors (including domestic settings)\n • 7th House in Libra contains Venus, relating to partnerships and possibly showing relational dynamics at play\n • 10th House MC in Capricorn and 4th House IC in Cancer define the themes of public duty versus domestic security\n • 12th House in Aquarius containing Saturn, Neptune, North Node, and Chiron indicates hidden or internalized issues, with several planets retrograde\n\n4. Major Aspects Involving Key Players:\n • Sun Opposition Neptune (0° orb) – Suggests confusion, illusions, or an element of escapism interfering with clear action\n • Mercury Square Jupiter (1° orb) – Indicates possible overstatement or miscommunication, infusing the situation with extra complication\n • Mercury Opposition Saturn (4° orb) – Points to restriction or delays in communication and thought processes that may force Suzanne to divert her attention elsewhere\n • Mars Opposition MC (1° orb) and Mars Conjunction IC (1° orb) – Highlight conflicts between her public or external responsibilities and domestic or personal needs\n • Venus Square Pluto (2° orb) – Denotes strong power dynamics, especially in relational or intimate matters, which may be acting as a disruptive force\n • Venus Opposition Ascendant (3° orb) – Reinforces issues in the realm of personal relationships or self-presentation, possibly reflecting interpersonal conflicts\n • Chiron Conjunction Ascendant (2° orb) – As noted, reinforces personal pain or wounding directly influencing her immediate actions\n • Mercury Trine Uranus (8° orb) – Offers moments of sharp insight or unexpected pivots; while less disruptive, it introduces sudden changes\n • Pluto Square Ascendant (5° orb) – Suggests potent transformative pressures upon Suzanne’s sense of self, often manifesting as a need to hide or withdraw\n\n5. Configurations and Patterns:\n • Grand Trine: Sun (Virgo), Pluto (Capricorn), and Uranus (Taurus) – Indicates an undercurrent of dynamic, stabilizing energy that can suddenly shift her situation\n • Kite Formation: Sun, Pluto, Uranus, and Neptune combine to invite a focused release of tension when triggered\n • Multiple T-Squares including:\n  – One T-Square with MC (10° Capricorn), North Node (6° Aries), and IC (10° Cancer) with Mars (9° Cancer) as the apex, reinforcing the tension between domestic obligations and external demands\n  – Another T-Square involving Venus (27° Libra), Pluto (29° Capricorn), and the Ascendant/Chiron (in Aries) highlighting disruptive interpersonal dynamics\n  – A third T-Square among Venus (27° Libra), Pluto (29° Capricorn), and Moon (5° Taurus) suggesting emotional intensity related to relationship issues\n  – A T-Square between Mercury (19° Virgo), Jupiter (20° Gemini), and Saturn (15° Pisces) that speaks to constricted communication or decision-making challenges\n • Yod: Involving Venus (27° Libra), Neptune (28° Pisces), and Uranus (27° Taurus) – Suggests a fated or karmic adjustment in the area of relationships and personal values\n\n6. Retrograde Factors:\n • Several planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, North Node, Chiron) being retrograde add an internalized, reflective quality to the event, potentially indicating that Suzanne’s actions and decisions were processed inwardly, with delays or reconsiderations affecting her behavior.\n\n7. Additional Technical Observations:\n • The chart shows a heavy emphasis on Earth and Cardinal qualities among the inner planets, pointing to a situation grounded in practical realities but initiated by a decision to change or take action.\n • The placements suggest that domestic matters (evidenced by Mars on the Nadir/IC and the configuration of the 4th house in Cancer) and personal vulnerabilities (via the Ascendant/Chiron contact) are strongly featured.\n • The interplay of communication (Mercury aspects) and relational tensions (Venus aspects) further indicates that whatever Suzanne was engaged in, it was intertwined with both personal discomfort and potential fallout in her partnerships.\n\nThis compilation of positions, aspects, patterns, and technical factors is the core dataset according to the event chart and horary principles.

On that trip to Germany with my soon-to-be ex-husband, when I met Stefan, something occurred. And I realized that he is my soulmate. And over the course of four days, I believe Stefan realized the same. Because he has subtly, using a movie reference, confessed that he has feelings for me. Although neither one of us are acting on it or crossing boundaries at this time.\n\n The dilemma that's been created is because the universe has shown me through horrory charts that Stefan will file for divorce and that he will openly confess his feelings for me and it will lead to a relationship of us together. \n\nHowever, my anxieties have created a situation where I drew too many horary charts to try to get an understanding of what would be going on because Stefan has pulled back from me and is not communicating at this time.\n\n It's likely that you don't remember this conversation with me because I know you have many clients, but You had advised me that I should stop Pulling horror each arts that I need to give lots of space in between to allow the universe to manifest What's been shown? If that's what I want to occur So I made a promise that I would not pull up any more horror each arts Until February the 12th, which is two days from now on the full moon.\n\n But this situation is bringing some new light. And I feel like I should pull up horary charts to confirm whether or not this is the case of what's happening and whether or not Stephan actually knows about it. But I don't know how that plays out from the universe's perspective of whether or not I would be allowed to pull up those charts because I did make a promise.\n\n Now, I don't want to pull any tarot cards or any form of divination just yet. I just want your guidance from your extensive knowledge in the field. Would I be able to pull up new horary charts without disrupting the universe and creating a negative energy by breaking a promise, or is it possible that I can pull up more event charts to get to the bottom of the matter, since those are from the past and have already occurred?
