I have isolated the elements pertinent to your query, with each point relating to the three key representations you outlined (you represented by the Ascendant, Stefan by the Ascendant’s 9th house, and Suzanne by the Ascendant’s 4th house):\n\n1. Key House Cusps and Their Representations\n • Client (You): Ascendant at 3°54′ Taurus\n • Suzanne (Stefan’s wife): Ascendant’s 4th House begins at 18° Cancer; in this house, Mars is present at 19°12′ Cancer (retrograde)\n • Stefan (extramarital interest): Represented by the Ascendant’s 9th House, beginning at 0° Capricorn; its planetary ruler is Saturn (ruling Capricorn), which is located in the 12th House at 17°56′ Pisces\n\n2. Planetary Placements in the Horary Chart\n • Ascendant (1st House, representing you):\n  – Moon in Taurus at 21°18′\n  – Uranus in Taurus at 23°16′\n • 2nd House in Gemini:\n  – Jupiter in Gemini at 11°16′\n • 4th House (Suzanne’s representative):\n  – Mars in Cancer at 19°12′ (retrograde)\n • 9th House (Stefan’s representative):\n  – The house cusp at 0° Capricorn (no direct planet placed here)\n  – Ruler Saturn found in the 12th House in Pisces\n • 10th House in Capricorn:\n  – Pluto in Capricorn at 2°12′ (not directly tied to the question but potentially influential in the overall chart dynamic)\n • 11th House in Aquarius:\n  – Sun in Aquarius at 17°05′\n  – Mercury in Aquarius at 14°16′\n • 12th House in Pisces (contains multiple factors influencing both the client and Stefan’s ruling planet):\n  – Venus in Aries at 0°57′\n  – Saturn in Pisces at 17°56′\n  – Neptune in Pisces at 28°06′\n  – North Node in Pisces at 29°36′ (retrograde)\n  – Chiron in Aries at 19°38′\n\n3. Major Aspects (with orbs that may be most relevant to relational tension and the overlays on the houses in question):\n • Mars in the 4th House forms a conjoining aspect with the IC (part of the T-Square involving MC and Chiron) with an orb of 1°\n • A T-Square pattern is present that connects:\n  – The MC at 18° Capricorn (shared with the broader accountability of career/public life issues)\n  – Chiron at 19° Aries (in the 12th House alongside Stefan’s ruling planet Saturn)\n  – The IC at 18° Cancer (which aligns with the 4th House containing Mars representing Suzanne)\n • Additional notable aspects from the chart include:\n  1. Mars Square Chiron (orb 0°)\n  2. MC Opposition IC (orb 0°)\n  3. Saturn Sextile MC (orb 1°)\n  4. Chiron Square IC (orb 1°)\n  5. Chiron Square MC (orb 1°)\n  6. Pluto Square Ascendant (orb 1°)\n  7. Mars Opposition MC (orb 1°)\n  8. Neptune Conjunction North Node (orb 1°)\n  9. Venus Conjunction North Node (orb 1°)\n  10. Saturn Trine IC (orb 1°)\n  …and several other sextiles, trines, and squares which further establish interplays among the 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, and 12th Houses.\n\n4. Notable Chart Patterns\n • T-Square: Formed among MC (18° Capricorn), Chiron (19° Aries), and IC (18° Cancer) with Mars (in the 4th House) as an active participant\n • Cradle Pattern: Involving Mars (4th House), MC (10th House), Saturn and Neptune (12th House), along with Moon and Uranus (1st House)\n  – These patterns emphasize inter-house tensions and potential for disruptive or unbalanced energies in matters of relationships and external involvements.\n\nThis compilation reflects the precise horary data required for your upcoming interpretation.

Planetary Placements in the Horary Chart\n • Ascendant (1st House, representing you):\n  – Moon in Taurus at 21°18′\n  – Uranus in Taurus at 23°16′\n • 2nd House in Gemini:\n  – Jupiter in Gemini at 11°16′\n • 4th House (Suzanne’s representative):\n  – Mars in Cancer at 19°12′ (retrograde)\n • 9th House (Stefan’s representative):\n  – The house cusp at 0° Capricorn (no direct planet placed here)\n  – Ruler Saturn found in the 12th House in Pisces\n • 10th House in Capricorn:\n  – Pluto in Capricorn at 2°12′ (not directly tied to the question but potentially influential in the overall chart dynamic)\n • 11th House in Aquarius:\n  – Sun in Aquarius at 17°05′\n  – Mercury in Aquarius at 14°16′\n • 12th House in Pisces (contains multiple factors influencing both the client and Stefan’s ruling planet):\n  – Venus in Aries at 0°57′\n  – Saturn in Pisces at 17°56′\n  – Neptune in Pisces at 28°06′\n  – North Node in Pisces at 29°36′ (retrograde)\n  – Chiron in Aries at 19°38′\n\n3. Major Aspects (with orbs that may be most relevant to relational tension and the overlays on the houses in question):\n • Mars in the 4th House forms a conjoining aspect with the IC (part of the T-Square involving MC and Chiron) with an orb of 1°\n • A T-Square pattern is present that connects:\n  – The MC at 18° Capricorn (shared with the broader accountability of career/public life issues)\n  – Chiron at 19° Aries (in the 12th House alongside Stefan’s ruling planet Saturn)\n  – The IC at 18° Cancer (which aligns with the 4th House containing Mars representing Suzanne)\n • Additional notable aspects from the chart include:\n  1. Mars Square Chiron (orb 0°)\n  2. MC Opposition IC (orb 0°)\n  3. Saturn Sextile MC (orb 1°)\n  4. Chiron Square IC (orb 1°)\n  5. Chiron Square MC (orb 1°)\n  6. Pluto Square Ascendant (orb 1°)\n  7. Mars Opposition MC (orb 1°)\n  8. Neptune Conjunction North Node (orb 1°)\n  9. Venus Conjunction North Node (orb 1°)\n  10. Saturn Trine IC (orb 1°)\n  …and several other sextiles, trines, and squares which further establish interplays among the 1st, 4th, 9th, 10th, and 12th Houses.\n\n4. Notable Chart Patterns\n • T-Square: Formed among MC (18° Capricorn), Chiron (19° Aries), and IC (18° Cancer) with Mars (in the 4th House) as an active participant\n • Cradle Pattern: Involving Mars (4th House), MC (10th House), Saturn and Neptune (12th House), along with Moon and Uranus (1st House)\n  – These patterns emphasize inter-house tensions and potential for disruptive or unbalanced energies in matters of relationships and external involvements.\n\nThis compilation reflects the precise horary data required for your upcoming interpretation. Confirm these details and indicate when you are ready to proceed with the interpretative phase."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 5, 2025 10:56am","gen_started":"2025-02-05T15:56:05.099Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T15:56:40.335Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

With you represented by the Ascendant, the clear tensions emerge when comparing Suzanne’s indicator in the 4th house and Stefan’s in the 9th house.\n\nKey indicators are as follows:\n\n• Suzanne’s representation (4th House, marked by Mars in Cancer at 19°12′ retrograde) shows a forceful, sometimes volatile domestic energy. Mars here signals that issues within the home are active and can involve conflicts or covert operations.\n\n• Stefan’s representative, the 9th House cusp (0° Capricorn), is governed by Saturn—located in the 12th House in Pisces—which strongly emphasizes secrecy and hidden matters. Saturn in the 12th suggests that any external involvement is carried out in the shadows and may involve heavy burdens of guilt or internal conflict.\n\n• The T-Square configuration between the MC (18° Capricorn), Chiron (19° Aries), and IC (18° Cancer) further intensifies tension in these key areas. Mars in the 4th (Suzanne’s indicator) is part of this pattern, marking a disruption that could be directly linked to secretive dynamics.\n\n• Additional aspects—such as Mars square Chiron and the involvement of planets (Neptune, Venus, North Node) in the 12th House—reinforce themes of hidden, sometimes deceptive emotional currents.

The hidden nature of Saturn in the 12th House, combined with the aggressive energy of Mars in Suzanne’s domain, shows that the situation is mired in secrecy and emotional turbulence. The configuration favors a scenario where Stefan is engaging in behavior that is not only outside the marital bounds but is deliberately conducted in the shadows, a dynamic that ultimately sets the stage for inevitable exposure and domestic upheaval.\n\nThe analysis, grounded in the horary principles and the specific placement of the planets and patterns, clearly supports the indication that Stefan is involved in an extra-marital affair and that this liaison is conducted covertly.","gen_started":"2025-02-05T15:56:47.255Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T15:57:00.067Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The chart reveals an intense interplay of energies that point to hidden, secretive matters in Stefan's affairs.

With the Ascendant at 3°54′ Taurus previously read and your reminder that the Ascendant is Venus and at 3° may cause interpretative ambiguity, it appears the chart you've provided now centers more strongly on you. When the Ascendant is ruled by Venus, its focus becomes intimate and personal. This positional nuance can render evaluations of external affairs less clear, since the Ascendant in essence reflects self-identity rather than external dynamics. The low degree—in this case, around 3°—may indeed signal a situation at or near a critical cusp, affecting the clarity of the indicators regarding connection and distance.\n\nGiven this, the established representations for Stefan and Suzanne may require reconfiguration.

This may involve positioning you in a different house or using an alternative starting point.\n • Stefan is represented unambiguously by a planet or house (such as the 9th house) that is not conflated with your own identity.\n • Suzanne is clearly linked with a distinct house (like the 4th house) with her own appropriate indicators.\n\n2. Consider using an alternative astrological method such as a split-chart technique.
