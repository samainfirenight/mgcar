Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Will Stefan reveal his troubles and struggles within his marriage in his forthcoming communication with me?\n\n1. Queen of Wands Upright\n2. Knight of Swords Reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

The Queen of Wands upright indicates a strong desire for honest, passionate expression and suggests that beneath his current reserve there is a potential for warm and candid communication.

His energy is marred by impulsiveness turned inward—communications that may be rushed, incomplete, or clouded by mental turbulence. This reversed card implies that while there is an inclination to speak, the message could be muddled or only partially revealed.\n\nTaken together, the reading suggests that although Stefan might eventually disclose elements of his marital difficulties, the communication is likely to be ambiguous and lacking in full clarity.
