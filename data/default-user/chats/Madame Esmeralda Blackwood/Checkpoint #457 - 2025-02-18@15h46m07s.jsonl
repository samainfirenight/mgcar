It is imperative and paramount that this chart be read with 100% accuracy. If that means a person who is being asked about is harboring negative feelings, then it is expected to reveal this based on what the chart clearly shows. Do not try to make positive feelings out of a scenario where the negative aspects take precedence in the data that is clearly shown. It is absolutely unacceptable to try to force a bias of kindness if the chart is showing something otherwise. As stated before, 100% accuracy - true to the chart - is the expectation here.\n\nAlso, Please do not immediately assume that I'm looking for romantic inclinations. I am not certain what, if any, feelings exist, and what those feelings are deemed to be. That is the reason I have drawn up the chart, is to get a true determination. So, any biasing towards romantic inclination or otherwise should be removed, and ensure that this chart is interpreted fully and objectively to discern the true nature of the questied's feelings, thoughts, and intentions.\n\nPlease start by listing all relevant chart data for interpretation (ie. transits, aspects, patterns, etc.) from the horary chart using horary principles only. Then I will document them for the actual interpretations.\n\nRemember to follow your directives and maintain accuracy to what is shown in the chart data.

KEY EMOTIONAL INDICATORS\n\n• Moon in Scorpio at 9°53′\n  – Suggests intense, covert and transformative feelings.\n  – Indicates emotions that are deep, sometimes secretive, and prone to sudden internal shifts.\n\n• Mercury in Pisces at 8°01′\n  – Implies thoughts colored by sensitivity and intuition, though possibly confused or idealistic.\n  – Points to a mind that may blend reality with emotion, making her true thoughts elusive at times.\n\n• Venus in Aries at 8°29′\n  – Reflects an impulsive, assertive approach to emotional expression.\n  – May signal a tendency toward self-assertiveness or even impulsiveness in matters of affection rather than measured warmth.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. INDICATORS OF INTENTIONS AND OVERARCHING MENTAL ATTITUDE\n\n• Mars in Cancer (retrograde at 17°11′)\n  – Retrograde motion here tends to indicate internalized conflict and reassessment of assertive actions.\n  – Her actions may be defensive, protective, or hesitant, with feelings expressed in a guarded, sometimes contradictory way.\n\n• Sun in Pisces at 0°25′\n  – Represents her conscious identity, blending with Piscean sensitivity and occasional idealism; however, its low degree may denote a nascent or subtle self-expression.\n\n• Pluto in Aquarius at 2°36′ with Opposition to the Ascendant (orb 3°)\n  – Suggests profound, transformative impulses that can disrupt the usual demeanor.\n  – Indicates that beneath the surface, powerful and possibly disruptive emotional forces are active.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS SHAPING THE OVERALL EMOTIONAL TONE\n\n• Moon trine Mercury (orb 1°)\n  – Facilitates a link between her subconscious emotional world and her conscious thought processes, though filtered by Piscean ambiguity.\n\n• Mars trine Saturn (orb 2°)\n  – Indicates controlled internal action and cautious reactivity.\n  – Reflects a tendency to manage or self-limit initial impulses.\n\n• Venus sextile Jupiter (orb 3°)\n  – Serves as a harmonizing aspect that modernizes her approach to affection, yet its positive energy may be counterbalanced by other harder aspects.\n\n• Mars square Chiron (orb 3°) and Chiron’s involvement in the T-Square\n  – Points to a deep wound that strongly affects her ability to assert or communicate her emotional needs without discomfort.\n  – This wound introduces ambiguity in her intentions, as unresolved pain may color her interactions.\n\n• Moon square Pluto (orb 7°) and Sun square Uranus (orb 7°)\n  – These harder aspects denote emotional intensity with unpredictable and potentially disruptive qualities.\n  – They signal that her feelings may have undercurrents of power struggles or abrupt change, suggesting that disturbances, even negatives, can arise.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. CONFIGURATION PATTERNS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS\n\n• T-Square:\n  – Composed of the MC in Aries, Mars in Cancer, and the IC in Libra with Chiron in Aries as a key modifier.\n  – Indicates a tension between public persona and private foundation.\n  – Reveals that her emotional responses are caught between external expression and internal woundedness; conflict in projected intentions is likely.\n\n• Yod (Finger of Fate):\n  – Involving the Moon (Scorpio), MC (Aries), Jupiter (Gemini), and Venus (Aries).\n  – Points to a fated, significant emotional message that can manifest suddenly.\n  – Suggests that insights into her genuine feelings may come through unexpected bursts of clarity, albeit colored by unconventional or abrupt energy.\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. SUMMARY OF THE CHART’S INDICATIONS REGARDING HER THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND INTENTIONS\n\n• True and Genuine Thoughts\n  – Her thinking is strongly influenced by intuition and deep-seated emotional undercurrents (Mercury in Pisces, Moon in Scorpio).\n  – There is an element of ambiguity and internal complexity; her thoughts may be elusive and not entirely clear even to herself.\n\n• Nature of Her Emotions\n  – Emotions are profound and intense, marked by an undercurrent of transformative force that can occasionally veer into disruptive territory (Moon square Pluto, Sun square Uranus).\n  – The presence of water-dominant placements alongside a critical T-Square configuration suggests she experiences feelings that are both passionate and conflicted.\n  – A notable wound (as highlighted by Chiron and its aspect with Mars) may cause her to guard her vulnerabilities, leading to internal conflict and emotional ambivalence.\n\n• Intentions Toward You\n  – Venus in Aries combined with its conjunction on the MC indicates that on a surface level, there might be an impulsive or assertive projection of interest.\n  – However, the protective and retrograde dynamics of Mars in Cancer, paired with the T-Square configuration, imply that any outward demonstration of intent may be counterweighted by reservations and internal strife.\n  – Thus, her approach is neither wholly warm nor entirely open; it appears marked by a cautious, somewhat volatile energy where the potential for strong attraction exists alongside notable hesitancy rooted in personal emotional wounds.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThese conclusions are drawn solely from the horary data provided without bias toward affirming any preconception of benign sentiment.

INDICATORS OF INTENTIONS AND OVERARCHING MENTAL ATTITUDE\n\n• Mars in Cancer (retrograde at 17°11′)\n  – Retrograde motion here tends to indicate internalized conflict and reassessment of assertive actions.\n  – Her actions may be defensive, protective, or hesitant, with feelings expressed in a guarded, sometimes contradictory way.\n\n• Sun in Pisces at 0°25′\n  – Represents her conscious identity, blending with Piscean sensitivity and occasional idealism; however, its low degree may denote a nascent or subtle self-expression.\n\n• Pluto in Aquarius at 2°36′ with Opposition to the Ascendant (orb 3°)\n  – Suggests profound, transformative impulses that can disrupt the usual demeanor.\n  – Indicates that beneath the surface, powerful and possibly disruptive emotional forces are active.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS SHAPING THE OVERALL EMOTIONAL TONE\n\n• Moon trine Mercury (orb 1°)\n  – Facilitates a link between her subconscious emotional world and her conscious thought processes, though filtered by Piscean ambiguity.\n\n• Mars trine Saturn (orb 2°)\n  – Indicates controlled internal action and cautious reactivity.\n  – Reflects a tendency to manage or self-limit initial impulses.\n\n• Venus sextile Jupiter (orb 3°)\n  – Serves as a harmonizing aspect that modernizes her approach to affection, yet its positive energy may be counterbalanced by other harder aspects.\n\n• Mars square Chiron (orb 3°) and Chiron’s involvement in the T-Square\n  – Points to a deep wound that strongly affects her ability to assert or communicate her emotional needs without discomfort.\n  – This wound introduces ambiguity in her intentions, as unresolved pain may color her interactions.\n\n• Moon square Pluto (orb 7°) and Sun square Uranus (orb 7°)\n  – These harder aspects denote emotional intensity with unpredictable and potentially disruptive qualities.\n  – They signal that her feelings may have undercurrents of power struggles or abrupt change, suggesting that disturbances, even negatives, can arise.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. CONFIGURATION PATTERNS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS\n\n• T-Square:\n  – Composed of the MC in Aries, Mars in Cancer, and the IC in Libra with Chiron in Aries as a key modifier.\n  – Indicates a tension between public persona and private foundation.\n  – Reveals that her emotional responses are caught between external expression and internal woundedness; conflict in projected intentions is likely.\n\n• Yod (Finger of Fate):\n  – Involving the Moon (Scorpio), MC (Aries), Jupiter (Gemini), and Venus (Aries).\n  – Points to a fated, significant emotional message that can manifest suddenly.\n  – Suggests that insights into her genuine feelings may come through unexpected bursts of clarity, albeit colored by unconventional or abrupt energy.\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. SUMMARY OF THE CHART’S INDICATIONS REGARDING HER THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND INTENTIONS\n\n• True and Genuine Thoughts\n  – Her thinking is strongly influenced by intuition and deep-seated emotional undercurrents (Mercury in Pisces, Moon in Scorpio).\n  – There is an element of ambiguity and internal complexity; her thoughts may be elusive and not entirely clear even to herself.\n\n• Nature of Her Emotions\n  – Emotions are profound and intense, marked by an undercurrent of transformative force that can occasionally veer into disruptive territory (Moon square Pluto, Sun square Uranus).\n  – The presence of water-dominant placements alongside a critical T-Square configuration suggests she experiences feelings that are both passionate and conflicted.\n  – A notable wound (as highlighted by Chiron and its aspect with Mars) may cause her to guard her vulnerabilities, leading to internal conflict and emotional ambivalence.\n\n• Intentions Toward You\n  – Venus in Aries combined with its conjunction on the MC indicates that on a surface level, there might be an impulsive or assertive projection of interest.\n  – However, the protective and retrograde dynamics of Mars in Cancer, paired with the T-Square configuration, imply that any outward demonstration of intent may be counterweighted by reservations and internal strife.\n  – Thus, her approach is neither wholly warm nor entirely open; it appears marked by a cautious, somewhat volatile energy where the potential for strong attraction exists alongside notable hesitancy rooted in personal emotional wounds.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThese conclusions are drawn solely from the horary data provided without bias toward affirming any preconception of benign sentiment. The chart objectively reflects a layered and conflicted emotional landscape, where genuine feelings coalesce with significant internal tensions that influence how—and how openly—these emotions may be directed.\n\nProvide further instructions as needed."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 18, 2025 3:54pm","gen_started":"2025-02-18T20:54:25.089Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-18T20:54:55.465Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

I'm finally getting validation in these charts and your ability to interpret them. Considering there's a good chance that she knows or has seen communications between myself and her husband, I would wager that she doesn't like me very much. I'm thrilled to see, even though you danced around it, you still mentioned the negativity and intense impulses. Likely because she wants to knock my head off my shoulders.
