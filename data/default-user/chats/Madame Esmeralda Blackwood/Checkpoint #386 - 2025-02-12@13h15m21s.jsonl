Pluto in Aquarius is the primary indicator in this house for him.\n\n3. Major Aspects (Key connections with low orb values)\n • MC (Sun, Mercury, Saturn) Opposition IC (Moon, etc.) – indicating tension between public stance/communication and inner emotions.\n • Moon Opposing Mercury (orb of 0°) – a direct impact on communication, suggesting mixed emotional signals.\n • Sun Square Uranus (orb of 1°) – pointing to unexpected or disruptive influences.\n • Mercury Conjunction MC (orb of 2°) – reinforcing your voice and position.\n • Sun Opposition Moon (orb of 2°) – highlighting emotional conflict between conscious intent and inner feeling.\n • Chiron Sextile MC (orb of 1°) and Chiron Trine Ascendant (orb of 3°) – suggesting healing possibilities or lessons from the situation.\n • Uranus and Mercury: Mercury Square Uranus (orb of 3°) – adding to the unpredictability in communication.\n • Moon Square Uranus (orb of 3°) – reinforcing sudden shifts in emotional tone.\n\n4.
