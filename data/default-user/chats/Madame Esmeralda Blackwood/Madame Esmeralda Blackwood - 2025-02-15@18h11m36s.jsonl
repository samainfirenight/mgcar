When Stefan and Suzanne married, it was primarily a marriage of convenience - what we might call a 'social contract.' Think of it as two people who decided to marry because it made sense on paper, perhaps for social status, financial security, or family expectations.\n\nHowever - and this is quite interesting - the stars show that beneath this practical arrangement, there was actually a deeper connection developing. While they may not have realized it at first, there was genuine potential for true love to grow between them.\n\nIt's rather like planting a garden, you see. They built the structure first - the fence, the soil beds, all very practical and planned. But within that carefully constructed space, something unexpected began to bloom - real feelings, genuine affection.\n\nThe chart suggests they likely approached their marriage quite intellectually at first - discussing terms, making plans, being very rational about the whole thing.

Both of them are natives of Munich, Germany. I'm pretty sure that Susanne is close to Stefan's age, perhaps maybe a year or two older than him, but not by much. Stefan is a very successful businessman. At the time, well, actually two years prior to his marriage to Susanne, he had already developed a successful career in marketing management, starting off at Adidas, then transitioning to Procter & Gamble, and then into global marketing director at Torqueedo.  All of that by the time he was 30.\n\n Two years later, when he married Suzanne, he took her surname in the marriage (Stein).  And not only that, when he sent out the e-mail invitations (for the formal ceremony) to his American cousins, he sent them from his own personal e-mail address. \n\nHowever, he made sure to include Suzanne on the correspondence, which that's not untypical. But in the joint signature, he put Suzanne's name first, multiple times on several correspondences. And it was very deliberate because one of the signatures had the ampersand, and then another one of the signatures had the actual word, 'and'. So it was deliberate.\n\n So, perhaps what I would really like to hone in on is what exactly brought them to the decision of marriage and what were the terms, what actually led to all of this? Because those actions, to me, don't seem exactly typical for a German man at that age, which he would have been 32 when he married Suzanne and still very successful. So why do all of that? \n\n And please, if I may ask, let's not do any tarot cards. I'd like to strictly stay to the chart and I'd like to maintain full accuracy to the chart data. Please.
