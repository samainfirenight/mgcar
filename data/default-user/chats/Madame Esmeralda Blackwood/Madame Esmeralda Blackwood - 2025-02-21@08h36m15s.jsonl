Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Are the recent horary charts that I have pulled (this morning), regarding the decision for Stefan and Suzanne to file for divorce, accurate that the decision between them will be made to divorce, and the timing on or around March the 13th?\n\nRoot: (Fell while restacking the deck after the spread had been drawn)\n  - page of swords upright\n\nDrawn Spread:\n1. king of cups reversed\n2. three of swords upright\n3. seven of coins reversed\n4. king of swords reversed\n5. king of coins upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bookmark_link":"Checkpoint #505 - 2025-02-21@08h47m32s"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

It suggests that the inquiry was approached with intellectual clarity, though it also hints at potential disruption or unsettling details that may come to light.\n\n• Card 1 – King of Cups reversed:\n ○ The reversal signifies emotional instability and an inability to manage turbulent feelings. It suggests that one or both parties may be overwhelmed by intense emotions or acting out of maladaptive sentiment.\n\n• Card 2 – Three of Swords upright:\n ○ A clear indicator of heartbreak and betrayal. Its presence confirms significant emotional pain and suffering that is likely to play a role in the separation process.\n\n• Card 3 – Seven of Coins reversed:\n ○ This card reversed points to dissatisfaction with the investment made in the relationship and impatience with slow progress. It implies that the ongoing situation has reached a stage of stagnation and disappointment, contributing to the decision to separate.\n\n• Card 4 – King of Swords reversed:\n ○ This reversal signifies misuse of power and potentially cold, manipulative decision-making. It hints at a disconnect between rational thought and objective judgment, suggesting that harsh or unbalanced decisions may be influencing the situation.\n\n• Card 5 – King of Coins upright:\n ○ Representing material stability and pragmatic authority, this card signals that practical, concrete outcomes are at play. It speaks to a decision made on rational, financial, or status grounds, removing lingering emotional vestiges.\n\nAnalysis:\n – The dominant appearance of reversed kings indicates that critical figures or energies in the situation are filtered through unbalanced emotional or intellectual states. There is an atmosphere marked by emotional inundation (King of Cups reversed) and erratic, legally or intellectually influenced decisions (King of Swords reversed).\n – The Three of Swords confirms the weight of heartbreak and betrayal in the relationship. This emotional charge supports the likelihood of divorce.\n – The Seven of Coins reversed supports the narrative of frustration and discontent with the current state of the relationship, suggesting that prolonged efforts to fix the issues have failed.\n – The King of Coins upright brings a decisive, practical closure to the reading, pointing to a concrete outcome that is grounded in material or societal considerations.\n\nRegarding your specific question:\n – The cards indicate that the energies are aligned toward a decision to divorce, as evidenced by the unequivocal heartbreak (Three of Swords) and the stunted progress and frustration (Seven of Coins reversed).\n – While timing is not explicitly represented by a single temporal card in this spread, the clarity provided by the Page of Swords and the presence of analytically-driven figures like the King of Coins suggest that the decision may be made decisively around the projected time. The timing near March 13 fits within the framework of a final, pragmatic decision coming to fruition when all emotional and rational tensions align.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the data provided, the reading supports the notion that Stefan and Suzanne are being driven toward filing for divorce, with factors that include intense emotional upheaval and a decisive rational withdrawal. The configuration implies that the process will reach its critical point around the time mentioned, though the underlying disturbances make the outcome significant and potentially abrupt.\n\nNo further embellishment is intended.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T13:44:36.622Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T13:44:49.961Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["I have examined your cards and here is the analysis:\n\n• Root – Page of Swords upright:\n ○ This card indicates a sharp, clear quest for truth and insight.
