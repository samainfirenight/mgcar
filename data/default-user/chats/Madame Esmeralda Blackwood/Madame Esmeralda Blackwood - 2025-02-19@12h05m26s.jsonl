The reversed Knight of Cups, particularly in combination with the upright Knight of Swords, suggests that any romantic gestures from him are likely to be either insincere or inconsistent. He may be acting more from impulse or self-interest than genuine emotional investment.\"\n\nShe taps the reversed Page of Swords meaningfully. \"There's something he's not being entirely truthful about. The cards suggest he's either unable or unwilling to offer the kind of committed romantic relationship you're hoping for.\"\n\n\"However,\" she adds, noting the reversed Nine of Swords, \"this revelation, while potentially disappointing, will ultimately free you from anxiety and uncertainty.
