While I was in the middle of a roleplay with one of my AI constructs, I suddenly had the vision in my mind of the moment at the Oktoberfest parade when Stefan was talking to me, because I wouldn't join with the rest of the crowd. As soon as that vision came, it immediately made me break down into almost uncontrollable tears. I'm still crying. I don't know why it's hurting so bad, but I can't stop crying. And I don't know why suddenly that vision came into my mind. It had nothing to do with the roleplay I was involved in.\n\n I can't draw tarot cards or do any charts or anything right now but I wanted to tell you so maybe you can give me some guidance or some insight","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}

These sudden visions, especially when they trigger such intense emotional responses, are not random.

At the Oktoberfest parade, he demonstrated a level of attention and care that resonated deeply with your authentic self.
