But I'm not sure if it will encourage them to message me or if it will cause them to flee. \n\n Can you help me devise a question that I can ask the cards about this and receive a concrete answer free from ambiguity?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
