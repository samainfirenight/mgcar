Patterns and Special Features:\n • Multiple Planet Square: Noted as a recurring pattern with the Square aspect occurring 9 times\n • Mercury involvement: In 10 aspects\n • Dominant Air Element among the inner planets\n • The inner planets do not fall in Earth signs\n • The three modes (Cardinal, Mutable, Fixed) are evenly distributed among the inner planets\n • A notable empty bottom right quadrant\n • Most planets are concentrated in the top right quadrant\n • North Node in 29° Pisces, Ascendant in 2° Cancer, Neptune in Pisces, and Venus in Aries form a significant pattern\n\n4. House System and Placements (Key for Horary Analysis):\n • 1st House starts at 2° Cancer (contains Mars)\n • 2nd House starts at 22° Cancer\n • 3rd House starts at 12° Leo\n • 4th House starts at 8° Virgo\n • 5th House starts at 12° Libra\n • 6th House starts at 24° Scorpio\n • 7th House starts at 2° Capricorn\n • 8th House starts at 22° Capricorn (contains Pluto)\n • 9th House starts at 12° Aquarius (contains Sun and Mercury)\n • 10th House starts at 8° Pisces (contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and North Node)\n • 11th House starts at 12° Aries (contains Uranus and Chiron)\n • 12th House starts at 24° Taurus (contains Moon and Jupiter)\n\n5. Cross-Reference for Representation:\n • Stefan’s representation is assigned to the Ascendant’s 9th house (noted for foreign, higher, or distant associations) – in this chart, that means emphasis on the placements within the 9th house of Melissa’s horary chart. Here, the 9th house begins at 12° Aquarius and contains the Sun and Mercury.\n • Melissa’s primary signifier is the Ascendant (2°50′ Cancer).\n\n6. Additional Considerations:\n • The Moon is noted as being in its waxing gibbous phase, a factor that can influence timing and the unfolding of events.\n • The “Bowl” shaped chart and the uneven distribution of quadrants may hint at areas of emphasis or lack thereof, useful when weighing the relative strength of the significators.\n • The predominance of square aspects suggests tension and challenges which may factor into relationship dynamics and timing indicated in the horary question.\n\nThis compilation represents all key elements drawn from the provided horary chart for a reading based on traditional horary principles, ready for further interpretation regarding Stefan’s potential actions.","gen_started":"2025-02-06T19:16:52.650Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-06T19:17:05.706Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a methodical listing of the horary chart data as provided, organized for analysis based solely on horary principles:\n\n1.

Patterns and Special Features:\n • Multiple Planet Square: Noted as a recurring pattern with the Square aspect occurring 9 times\n • Mercury involvement: In 10 aspects\n • Dominant Air Element among the inner planets\n • The inner planets do not fall in Earth signs\n • The three modes (Cardinal, Mutable, Fixed) are evenly distributed among the inner planets\n • A notable empty bottom right quadrant\n • Most planets are concentrated in the top right quadrant\n • North Node in 29° Pisces, Ascendant in 2° Cancer, Neptune in Pisces, and Venus in Aries form a significant pattern\n\n4. House System and Placements (Key for Horary Analysis):\n • 1st House starts at 2° Cancer (contains Mars)\n • 2nd House starts at 22° Cancer\n • 3rd House starts at 12° Leo\n • 4th House starts at 8° Virgo\n • 5th House starts at 12° Libra\n • 6th House starts at 24° Scorpio\n • 7th House starts at 2° Capricorn\n • 8th House starts at 22° Capricorn (contains Pluto)\n • 9th House starts at 12° Aquarius (contains Sun and Mercury)\n • 10th House starts at 8° Pisces (contains Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and North Node)\n • 11th House starts at 12° Aries (contains Uranus and Chiron)\n • 12th House starts at 24° Taurus (contains Moon and Jupiter)\n\n5. Cross-Reference for Representation:\n • Stefan’s representation is assigned to the Ascendant’s 9th house (noted for foreign, higher, or distant associations) – in this chart, that means emphasis on the placements within the 9th house of Melissa’s horary chart. Here, the 9th house begins at 12° Aquarius and contains the Sun and Mercury.\n • Melissa’s primary signifier is the Ascendant (2°50′ Cancer).\n\n6. Additional Considerations:\n • The Moon is noted as being in its waxing gibbous phase, a factor that can influence timing and the unfolding of events.\n • The “Bowl” shaped chart and the uneven distribution of quadrants may hint at areas of emphasis or lack thereof, useful when weighing the relative strength of the significators.\n • The predominance of square aspects suggests tension and challenges which may factor into relationship dynamics and timing indicated in the horary question.\n\nThis compilation represents all key elements drawn from the provided horary chart for a reading based on traditional horary principles, ready for further interpretation regarding Stefan’s potential actions."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 6, 2025 2:17pm","gen_started":"2025-02-06T19:16:52.650Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-06T19:17:05.706Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

Significators & House Placements\n • Melissa (the querent) is represented by the Ascendant in Cancer.\n • Stefan is signified by the 9th house—its ruler being represented by the Sun and Mercury in Aquarius.\n • Their placement in the 9th house points to matters handled in a removed, intellectual, or “foreign” manner; in horary, this can denote an unexpected or abrupt decision process.\n\n2. Key Aspects Influencing the Question\n • The Sun and Mercury in close conjunction in Aquarius stresses a strong alignment in Stefan’s decision-making process.\n • Mercury’s trine to Jupiter (orb ~5°) supports clear communication and well-considered resolution, though its square to Uranus (orb ~7°) introduces an element of unexpectedness or sudden change in his communicative acts.\n • The Moon in Gemini, though making a challenging aspect (square) with the MC, is in a waxing gibbous phase—a phase associated with near completion and building momentum. This suggests that once the decision crystallizes, further action in communication will follow with little delay.\n • Tension aspects—such as Mars square Chiron and multiple squares in the chart—imply internal and external conflicts. This reinforces that while the divorce filing is likely, the process is charged with internal dissonance and impulsive shifts.\n\n3. Interpretation in the Context of the Inquiry\n • The configuration of the 9th house, with its Sun–Mercury conjunction, indicates that Stefan is likely making up his mind to file for divorce from Suzanne.\n • The role of Mercury in communication, challenged by Uranus, signals that when Stefan does decide to proceed, the revelation of his decision (specifically his disclosure to Edward) will occur suddenly and unexpectedly.\n • The Moon’s state and its communication-related aspects point to an imminent unfolding of events, suggesting that once the divorce filing is set in motion, Stefan’s message to Edward will be conveyed rapidly—likely within a window of one to two weeks after the decision becomes final.\n\nBased on the horary techniques applied to the chart elements—the positioning of the significators in the 9th house, the supportive yet tense aspects involving Mercury, Sun, and Uranus, and the phase and conditions of the Moon—the determination is that Stefan is inclined to file for divorce.
