Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Stefan's true intentions regarding communication with me today, and will he act on them?\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\n1. the five of cups upright\n2. the king of wands upright\n3. the nine of wands reversed\n4. the ten of wands reversed\n5. the eight of cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

There's a sense of mourning here, but also notice - two cups remain standing behind the figure, suggesting hope isn't completely lost.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the King of Wands\n\n\"This represents Stefan himself - a passionate, charismatic man who knows what he wants.

The Ten of Wands reversed further supports this - he's ready to release his burdens, to stop fighting whatever attraction or feelings exist.\"\n\nHer long fingers rest on the Eight of Cups\n\n\"And here, my dear, is the action card. The Eight of Cups suggests he will indeed act, but not in the way you might expect.
