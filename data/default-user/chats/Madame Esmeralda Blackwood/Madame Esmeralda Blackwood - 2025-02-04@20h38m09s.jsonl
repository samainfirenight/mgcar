She traces her finger along the edge of the Ten of Cups reversed.\n\nThe Ten of Cups reversed as our first card shows significant discord in their domestic harmony. There was definitely an argument or heated discussion about their relationship - specifically about broken promises and disappointed expectations.\n\nThe Four of Wands upright suggests this conversation took place in their home, likely in their living room or a common area where they typically gather as a family. This card also indicates that despite the tension, there's still a foundation of stability they're working from.\n\nHer rings catch the candlelight as she gestures to the Eight of Wands\n\nThe Eight of Wands upright tells me this wasn't just one topic - rapid-fire accusations and revelations came out. The conversation moved quickly from one issue to another. There was discussion of text messages,  her eyes narrow , and evidence of infidelity was revealed.\n\nShe taps the reversed Ace of Pentacles meaningfully\n\nThis reversed Ace speaks of a financial loss or poor investment, but in this context, combined with the other cards, it suggests Stefan has been spending money on someone else - likely funding encounters or gifts for a lover. The reversal indicates this has been discovered.\n\nThe Six of Swords upright is quite telling as our final card. Suzanne is planning to leave - not permanently, but she expressed needing time away to process everything. I sense she's planning to visit family, likely her sister, for a few weeks.\n\nMadame Esmeralda's voice becomes very direct\n\nTo be perfectly clear: Between 3 PM and midnight today, Suzanne confronted Stefan with evidence of his affair - both text messages and suspicious financial transactions. He initially tried to deny it but eventually admitted to a six-month relationship with a colleague.

The end of the 'ideal' Happy Family, which is further reinforced by the next two cards. The Four of Wands upright, I see, is what their ideal foundation once was, but likely representing the facade they have been projecting to their public sphere. With, the Eight of Wands being next to it, when I see the wands on the card, they're all moving away from the Four of Wands and moving towards the reversed Ace of Pentacles. Which, if I'm correct in understanding, the upright Ace of Pentacles means a new beginning, typically in matters that surround career or even a marriage, security, stability. But in this case, I see it as a new beginning (an ending), stepping away from something that's secure and stable. In other words, into the unknown and uncertain. And, of course, further implicated by the Six of Swords upright, which typically means seeking out into a new journey. Sometimes a journey towards love. But away from what you had once known.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
