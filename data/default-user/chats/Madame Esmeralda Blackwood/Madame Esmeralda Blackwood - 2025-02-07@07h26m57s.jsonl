Representative Assignments\n • Inquirer (Melissa): Represented by the Ascendant and its immediate supports.\n • Stefan: As the Ascendant’s 9th house (foreign/partner area) is empty, he is represented by the house ruler – here designated as Mars.\n  – Mars is retrograde in Cancer at 18°47′, placed in the 6th House.\n • Suzanne: Represented by Jupiter because she occupies the Ascendant’s 4th house (Stefan’s 7th in this context).\n  – Jupiter is in Gemini at 11°17′, located in the 4th House (which also contains the Moon).\n\n3.

Representation of Parties\n • The inquirer (Melissa) is affirmed by the Ascendant in Aquarius.\n • Stefan is represented by Mars—the ruler of the Ascendant’s 9th house—found in Cancer and retrograde in the 6th house. This retrogression implies internal hesitancy and delays in matters concerning his role or actions.\n • Suzanne is represented by Jupiter, occupying the 4th house (the domicile for domestic affairs and partnership as mapped here). Jupiter in Gemini denotes a mutable and inconsistent quality, suggesting that while Suzanne’s emotions and opinions may shift, there is no forceful drive toward immediate action.\n\n2. Chart Dynamics and Aspects\n • The Aquarian stellium (Sun, Mercury, Saturn, and Pluto) on the Ascendant emphasizes a rational, unconventional approach to personal matters. This energy tends toward analysis and measured responses rather than impulsive decisions.\n • Mars in Cancer, being retrograde and placed in the 6th house, points to inner conflict and a lack of aggressive forward movement. Its aspects—a favorable trine to Saturn but a challenging square to Chiron—signal a balance between discipline and lingering personal wounds, which may undercut decisive moves regarding marital matters.\n • Jupiter’s placement in Gemini, although receiving supportive aspects (trines with the Sun and Mercury), is weakened by its natural detriment in this mutable sign, indicating that Suzanne’s disposition towards change is marked by uncertainty rather than resolution.\n • The Moon’s location in the 4th house reinforces the emotional ties connected to home and domestic life. The Moon’s conjunction with Jupiter, even at a wider orb, enhances the emotional responsiveness of Suzanne’s representative but does not compel a sharp, unilateral action.\n\n3. Interpretation of the Outcome\n • The absence of harsh or severely afflicting aspects targeting Jupiter suggests that, despite the undercurrents of tension, there is no strong impetus for Suzanne to take the drastic step of filing for divorce at this time.\n • Mars’s retrograde motion alongside its supportive trine to Saturn implies an environment of internal reassessment on Stefan’s part rather than overt conflict that might otherwise prompt a decisive legal action.\n • The overall configuration reflects a state of cautious re-evaluation and lingering indecision regarding the marital situation. The patterns indicate that while there is noticeable strain and susceptibility to change, the energies present do not favor an immediate filing of divorce by Suzanne.\n\nBased on these factors, the indication is that Suzanne is unlikely to file for divorce on her own initiative under the current chart conditions.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T12:32:18.323Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T12:32:36.503Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Reviewing the horary data with strict adherence to traditional principles, the following emerges:\n\n1.
