With you (Melissa) represented by the Ascendant surrounded by Aquarius stellium—and Stefan’s affairs indicated by the 9th House via Libra’s ruler Venus—the condition of Venus becomes essential. Venus, positioned in Pisces in the 2nd House, forms an immediate, exact conjunction with Neptune. This union traditionally points toward a situation where clarity is compromised. Neptune’s influence can create illusion or distortion, suggesting that the stated conditions may be subject to embellishment or misinterpretation.\n\n2. Venus’s close involvement with the North Node further emphasizes that there is an element of destiny or fated miscommunication in the matter. In modern horary, such a combination raises the possibility that the reported illness, rather than being a straightforward account, is tainted by uncertainty and possibly by exaggeration or misperception.\n\n3. Mars, located in the 6th House of health and appearing retrograde in Cancer, squares Chiron. This aspect may hint at real discomfort or disruptive conditions affecting health; however, the retrograde motion of Mars and its challenging aspect to Chiron, while pointing to some genuine distress, do not clearly resolve the authenticity of the reported sickness. Instead, they contribute additional nuance: a degree of actual physical stress could be present, yet it might be less severe than described or further confused by external factors.\n\n4. The overall chart configuration—dominated by two stelliums (one in Aquarius and the other in Pisces), strong Piscean influences in the indicators for health and miscommunication, and empty sectors that emphasize subjective areas over clear factual domains—suggest that matters concerning Stefan and his children are enveloped in uncertainty. The potent effect of Neptune on Venus—whose role here directly connects to Stefan’s representation—leans toward an atmosphere where the truth is diluted.\n\nBased on these elements, the evidence appears mixed.
