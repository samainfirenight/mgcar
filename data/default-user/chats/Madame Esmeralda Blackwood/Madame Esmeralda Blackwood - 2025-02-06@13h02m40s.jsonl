Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Is there a third love interest in Stefan's sphere right now who holds the true desire of his heart, That is not me and that is not his wife, Suzanne?\n\n1. Strength Upright\n2. Two of wands reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
