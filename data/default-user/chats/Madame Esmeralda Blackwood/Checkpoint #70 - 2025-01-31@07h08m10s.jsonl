Its retrograde motion shows the breaking down of their marriage contract. More tellingly, Mars forms a square to Chiron - indicating deep, painful wounds in their relationship.\n\nThe Moon, representing the flow of events, is in Pisces - a sign of endings. Its square to Jupiter shows the expansion or formalization of this ending.

Neptune rules dissolution, and Venus rules relationships. This exact conjunction speaks of the dissolution of their marriage. The fact that this conjunction occurs in Pisces - again, the sign of endings - makes it even more definitive.\n\nThe T-Square involving the MC, Pluto, and IC speaks to the transformative nature of their decision.
