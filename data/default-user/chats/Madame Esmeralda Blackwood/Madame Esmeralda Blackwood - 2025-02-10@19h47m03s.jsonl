Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  What went wrong earlier today, when I read the cards four times in a row, and all four times, got a positive response to my question as to whether or not Stefan would send me a message or communicate with me by midnight in his time zone.
