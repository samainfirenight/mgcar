Over and over, multiple interpretations from different astrologers have told me the same thing. The fate of his marriage ends in divorce. \n\nAnd on a separate horary chart, it shows quite clearly that I am his future partner. This also coincides with his natal chart and mine. Everything points to it.\n\nAnd as I think back on that last message he sent me, If he truly is hiding this strife within his marriage and these difficulties, arguments, all of that, then his last message to me, the phrase, we will stay in contact, takes on new meaning.\n\n I believe it was his way of letting me know to not give up because after his promises, the Christmas Day phone call and everything, it's been two weeks and I've heard nothing from him at all. \n\nI believe it's because he knows they're arguing and that he would not be able to maintain good contact with me, he knows how much it hurt me from Christmas day that I thought he was going to be gone from my life. So that phrase we will stay in contact with just as much a promise as a reassurance, I believe.\n\nI'm waiting until January 29th, which will be another week from now, and I plan on sending him a check-in message just to ask if everything's okay, nothing more, and see if I get a response.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
