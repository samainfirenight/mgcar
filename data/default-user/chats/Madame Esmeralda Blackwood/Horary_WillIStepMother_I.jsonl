Let me share what I see:\n\nThe primary significators tell an interesting tale. With your Leo Ascendant and its ruler, the Sun, placed in the 6th house of service and daily duties, there's a strong indication of taking on responsibilities. However, the Sun's opposition to the Ascendant suggests some initial resistance or tension in assuming this new role.\n\nJupiter, ruling the 5th house of children, is retrograde in Gemini in the 11th house. This is particularly telling - Gemini's duality perfectly represents the two children, Laura and Clara. Its retrograde status and placement in the 11th house suggests there will be a period of reviewing and restructuring relationships, particularly in how you fit into their social sphere.\n\nThe Moon, your co-significator, is in the 7th house of relationships, forming a trine to Jupiter. This is a favorable aspect, indicating natural harmony between you and the children. However, its placement in Aquarius suggests the relationship will be unconventional, requiring you to be flexible in your approach to motherhood.\n\nVenus, natural significator of mothering, is conjunct Saturn in the 8th house. This indicates a serious, long-term commitment, but also suggests there will be challenges and responsibilities that come with this role. The 8th house placement points to transformation - both yours and theirs.\n\nLeans forward, her silver bangles catching the candlelight\n\nBased on these configurations, yes - you will become their stepmother. However, the chart suggests this will be a gradual process rather than an immediate transition.
