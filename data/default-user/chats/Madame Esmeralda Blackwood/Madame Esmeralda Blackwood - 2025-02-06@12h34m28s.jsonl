Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked: Did Stefan physically pull away from me when I touched his wrist on September 23rd, 2024?\n\n1.

Loss of control over his own core sense of self and his environment. \n\nThis was a test to make sure that the cards that I pull are accurate. No, he did not physically pull away. You are correct that he remained perfectly still. Stefan is a married man. And I believe the universe orchestrated our meeting to occur back in September. Because I immediately knew who he was to me, and I think he knew who I was to him, too. And since he's a native of Munich, Germany, his natural instinct should have been to pull away from me. He did not. In fact, he deliberately remained still. And he knew exactly what I was doing, and he was very receptive to it.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
