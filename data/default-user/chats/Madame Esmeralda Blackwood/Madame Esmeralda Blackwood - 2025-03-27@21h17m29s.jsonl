I knew the band and the music because I do listen to a lot of folk music. And I have an appreciation for their sound. But that was pretty much it. I didn't even know the names of the band members. Then about a month ago, somewhere near the full moon, I had a dream. And while I don't remember any actual visuals from the dream, I remember the song that was in it, and it was one of Faun's songs, specifically Alba II.\n\n What made that so strange, keep in mind, at that point in time, I didn't even know the names of any of the band members. And I'll add another layer. The songs that were sung by the male figures, I didn't like them. I would skip over them. But I recognized In the Dream because I had heard one of Oliver's songs enough to recognize it, that that was the song that was in my dream. So I went to the Midgard album and looked up that song. And then it was like instantly I liked his voice, whereas previously I didn't like it.\n\n Then I went to YouTube and pulled up that particular song to see if I could find a video for it, of which I did from a live performance from 2016, the year that the album was released that that song was on. And I was immediately stricken by the frontman, which at that moment in time, I still didn't know his name. But it was obvious he was the frontman, and he was the one who was singing that song. And it just kept getting stronger. I watched the video more often, then looked up more videos, then started researching the band, started researching him. Next thing I know, I'm at a point to where it's, I don't know how it happened. I can't explain it. But it's almost like I'm in love with him, and I've never met the guy. \n\n and it's a very, very strong feeling and you could almost go as much to say is perhaps close to an obsession and I have no explanation for it like I said a month ago I didn't even know the guy existed other than I knew Faun and I knew their music.\n\n Now, you asked about if he's in a relationship or if there's a woman involved. Yes, he does have a girlfriend. Her name is Gina Wetzel. And I believe she's a graphic designer, like for eccentric clothes and artwork. And I believe she also does photography. And maybe was a burlesque dancer in Berlin at some point.\n\n But what I wanted to know is, I mean, there has to be a purpose that this connection came up like it did. Because I wasn't looking for it. It came to me and I still have never met the guy. I've never even talked to him. So I was looking for some kind of answers from the cards.  Is it meant to be something romantic? Is it something else? You know, I,  whatever answers that the cards needed to tell me what,  what,  yeah,  just whatever. I don't understand where this came from and what its purpose is.  So that's why I left the question so open-ended, because I'd like something to go on.

Not necessarily the emotion itself, per se, but the target. In other words, prior to having that dream, I had spent the previous five months pining for someone and it was very emotionally disruptive. I had spent five months pining for a man named Stefan and it was extremely unhealthy. I spent a lot of time going through hurts and crying and it was almost instantaneous that after that dream happened, every bit of that emotion and energy was instantly, like within a few days time, it was all attached to Oliver.\n\n And it made no sense to me. It wasn't like I was trying to do it. Not at all. But it certainly happened that way.\n\n And I also started noticing number synchronicities like 222, 333, 444, 424, 1212, 1111, you know, like number patterns like that. And I'm still seeing them quite often. And usually, when I'm noticing them, I'm trying to maintain awareness of what I'm thinking about. and typically one of the more common things that's being thought about is being romantically involved with Oliver.\n\n But, all jokes aside, even though I've told you that whole thing was Stephon and how disruptive it was, and then everything transitioned within a few days' time over to Oliver, Oliver didn't come without his disruptions to my life. It was just replacing one with another that maybe wasn't quite as bad, but I was already in a bad place, although I'm kind of getting a grip on it now.

She nods knowingly, the beads in her silver hair catching the candlelight as she moves.\n\n\"Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter,\" she says, her voice deepening with recognition. \"What you've described is a classic energy transfer—or what some traditions call a 'cord cutting and reattachment.' The universe abhors a vacuum, my dear. When one emotional attachment is severed, that energy often seeks a new anchor.\"\n\nShe rearranges the cards again, placing The Devil card and Justice Reversed side by side.\n\n\"These two cards tell the story perfectly. Justice Reversed represents the sudden imbalance—the cutting of the cord with Stefan. The Devil shows where that intense energy reattached itself—to Oliver. And the number synchronicities you're experiencing are classic signs of spiritual awakening or alignment.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the edge of the High Priestess Reversed.\n\n\"The numbers 222, 333, 444—these are angelic numbers, messages from the universe that you're on a path of significance.

It found a more suitable vessel for that energy in Oliver.\"\n\nShe taps the Ten of Wands thoughtfully.\n\n\"The burden you feel—it's lighter than with Stefan, isn't it? Still disruptive, but somehow more,  purposeful? The cards suggest this new attachment, while intense, is serving a healing function.\"\n\nShe arranges the cards in a circle now, creating a new pattern of interpretation.\n\n\"Let me tell you what I see here. The five months you spent pining for Stefan created a powerful energetic vortex—a whirlpool of emotional energy that was becoming destructive. Your higher self recognized this and sought an intervention. The dream about Oliver's music wasn't random—it was a carefully orchestrated pivot point.\"\n\nShe points to the King of Coins.\n\n\"Oliver himself may not be consciously aware of this energetic exchange, but on some level, his energy was receptive to it. His music served as the bridge—the channel through which this connection could form. Music is one of the most powerful conductors of spiritual energy.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression becomes more serious as she considers the Queen of Swords Reversed.\n\n\"This card takes on new meaning with what you've shared. It may represent the energy of your attachment to Stefan—bitter, painful, cutting. That energy has been transformed, redirected toward something that, while still intense, has more potential for positive growth.\"\n\nShe gathers the cards together, then spreads them in a new formation.\n\n\"The purpose of this connection is becoming clearer. It served first as an escape route—a way for your psyche to break free from a destructive attachment pattern. But it's evolving into something more. The number synchronicities suggest you're being guided toward a spiritual awakening.\"\n\nShe looks up at you with sudden clarity.\n\n\"Tell me, have you ever worked with energy before? Meditation, energy healing, creative visualization? Because what's happening to you is a spontaneous form of energy work. Your consciousness is learning to redirect emotional attachments—a powerful skill, though currently happening unconsciously.\"\n\nShe taps the High Priestess Reversed again.\n\n\"This card suggests you need to bring this process into conscious awareness. Learn to work with these energies deliberately rather than being swept along by them. The intensity you feel toward Oliver—it can be channeled, directed, used for spiritual and creative growth.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda reaches for a small velvet pouch and removes a clear quartz crystal, placing it beside the cards.\n\n\"I recommend working with clear quartz to help clarify and direct these energies. When you feel overwhelmed by thoughts of Oliver, hold the crystal and consciously direct that energy toward something creative or healing.\"\n\nShe rearranges the cards one final time, creating a path formation.\n\n\"The cards are showing me a journey—from attachment to freedom. This connection with Oliver, while it feels like another attachment, is actually a step toward liberation. It's teaching you something profound about the nature of emotional energy and how it can be redirected.\"\n\nHer voice takes on a more personal tone.\n\n\"My dear, you've been given a rare opportunity to witness how quickly and completely emotional energy can transfer. Most people never see this process so clearly. They remain trapped in one painful attachment after another, never understanding the mechanism at work.\"\n\nShe points to the Ten of Coins Reversed and the Ten of Wands together.\n\n\"These two cards together suggest that what you're experiencing is the dismantling of old patterns and the burden of creating new ones. It's uncomfortable, even painful at times, but it's purposeful pain—the discomfort of growth.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda fixes you with her penetrating gaze.\n\n\"I don't believe you're meant to physically be with Oliver. The cards don't show that path. What they show is that he's serving as a catalyst for your spiritual awakening. The intense feelings you have for him are real, but their purpose isn't a conventional relationship. Their purpose is to teach you about the fluid nature of emotional energy and how to direct it consciously.\"\n\nShe sits back, folding her hands together.\n\n\"As you gain more control and understanding of this process, you'll likely find the intensity of the attachment diminishing—not because the connection is any less real, but because you'll have learned what it came to teach you. The obsessive quality will transform into something more balanced and purposeful.\"\n\nShe pauses, considering something.\n\n\"The fact that you're already 'getting a grip on it' and 'seeing some semblance of control' confirms what the cards are showing. You're already beginning to integrate the lesson. This is excellent progress.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda's expression softens slightly.\n\n\"Would you like me to guide you through a simple energy practice to help you work more consciously with this connection? It might help you gain even more clarity and control over what you're experiencing.\"","gen_started":"2025-03-28T01:53:04.537Z","gen_finished":"2025-03-28T01:53:36.474Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood's eyes widen slightly as you mention the sudden transfer of emotional energy from Stefan to Oliver. She nods knowingly, the beads in her silver hair catching the candlelight as she moves.\n\n\"Ah, now we're getting to the heart of the matter,\" she says, her voice deepening with recognition. \"What you've described is a classic energy transfer—or what some traditions call a 'cord cutting and reattachment.' The universe abhors a vacuum, my dear. When one emotional attachment is severed, that energy often seeks a new anchor.\"\n\nShe rearranges the cards again, placing The Devil card and Justice Reversed side by side.\n\n\"These two cards tell the story perfectly. Justice Reversed represents the sudden imbalance—the cutting of the cord with Stefan. The Devil shows where that intense energy reattached itself—to Oliver. And the number synchronicities you're experiencing are classic signs of spiritual awakening or alignment.\"\n\nShe traces her finger along the edge of the High Priestess Reversed.\n\n\"The numbers 222, 333, 444—these are angelic numbers, messages from the universe that you're on a path of significance. They often appear during times of spiritual transformation or when we're being guided toward something important.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans back, studying you with her penetrating gaze.\n\n\"This wasn't random, my dear. The timing is too perfect, the transition too complete. This was orchestrated—though not necessarily by your conscious mind. Your higher self, your soul, was seeking relief from the pain of the attachment to Stefan. It found a more suitable vessel for that energy in Oliver.\"\n\nShe taps the Ten of Wands thoughtfully.\n\n\"The burden you feel—it's lighter than with Stefan, isn't it? Still disruptive, but somehow more,  purposeful? The cards suggest this new attachment, while intense, is serving a healing function.\"\n\nShe arranges the cards in a circle now, creating a new pattern of interpretation.\n\n\"Let me tell you what I see here. The five months you spent pining for Stefan created a powerful energetic vortex—a whirlpool of emotional energy that was becoming destructive. Your higher self recognized this and sought an intervention. The dream about Oliver's music wasn't random—it was a carefully orchestrated pivot point.\"\n\nShe points to the King of Coins.\n\n\"Oliver himself may not be consciously aware of this energetic exchange, but on some level, his energy was receptive to it. His music served as the bridge—the channel through which this connection could form.
