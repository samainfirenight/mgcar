Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\n I'm having some difficulties because I'm getting some strange feelings of intuition that are invalidating my most recent horary charts that I've drawn up in regards to when Stefan would contact me. Now, before any assumptions are made, I do not interpret my own charts. I bring everything that I have for interpretation to you specifically. So, let that be known before I do this tarot reading. These cards better speak the truth from the universe, No ambiguity, no hidden meanings, just straight forward tell me because I'm pissed and I'm about ready to tell this whole goddamn thing to fuck off.\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Show me why I'm suddenly getting a strange intuitive feeling that the horary charts that I've drawn up and tarot readings that I've done telling me Stefan will contact me within the next four days are wrong.  \n\n1.

There is a solid structure and work being invested, suggesting that your past evaluations were based on sound methods.\n• King of Wands, Upright: Conveys a vibrant, assertive energy and personal drive; it may represent a dynamic quality in the situation or an influential person.\n• King of Coins, Reversed: Points to instability or mismanagement in material or practical matters. This card suggests that if Stefan’s energy is embodied here, his approach or circumstances may be blocked, unreliable, or not as forthright as expected.\n• Four Swords, Reversed: Reflects a state of unrest and a breakdown in necessary recovery. Energetic or mental stress may be interfering with clear communication; the calm required to allow natural progress is absent.\n• Two of Coins, Upright: Signifies juggling multiple responsibilities or conflicting influences. It implies that the energies at work are in flux, requiring careful balance; competing priorities might be hindering the expected contact.\n• Two of Wands, Reversed: Reveals indecision and a reluctance to commit to plans or move forward.

Fundamental Data\n\n• Question: “Will Stefan ever contact me again in this lifetime, and if so, when specifically will this contact occur?”\n• Representation:\n – Querent (You) is represented by the Ascendant (1st House).\n – Stefan is represented by the Ascendant’s 9th House (the foreign/other house); note that the ruler of the 9th house (beginning at 19° Aries) is Mars (as Aries is ruled by Mars).\n\n• Chart Details:\n – Date/Time/Location: February 24, 2025, at 5:39 PM in South Lyon, Michigan, United States.\n – Ascendant: 29°49′ Leo\n – Midheaven (MC): 23°32′ Taurus\n – Imum Coeli (IC): 23°32′ Scorpio\n\n────────────────────────────\nII. Planetary Positions and Their Likely House Placements (per provided house boundaries)\n\n1. Sun: 6°34' Pisces\n – Located in the 7th House (House 7 begins at 29° Aquarius, containing Sun, Mercury, and Saturn).\n\n2. Moon: 26°00' Capricorn\n – Located in the 5th House (House 5 starts at 2° Capricorn; it contains the Moon and Pluto).\n\n3. Mercury: 19°15' Pisces\n – Located in the 7th House (with Sun and Saturn).\n\n4. Venus: 10°19' Aries\n – Located in the 8th House (House 8 starts at 22° Pisces and contains Venus, Neptune, and the North Node).\n\n5. Mars: 17°01' Cancer\n – Located in the 11th House (House 11 starts at 2° Cancer; Mars here may indicate Stefan’s active energy via the 9th-house rulership link).\n\n6. Jupiter: 11°58' Gemini\n – Located in the 10th House (House 10 starts at 23° Taurus; it is declared that Jupiter and Uranus are in House 10).\n\n7. Saturn: 20°11' Pisces\n – Located in the 7th House (with Sun and Mercury).\n\n8. Uranus: 23°32' Taurus\n – Located in the 10th House (with Jupiter).\n\n9.

I outline below the key chart elements and their implications according to horary principles:\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. Representation of Parties\n • Querent (You): Represented by the Ascendant at 29°49′ Leo.\n • Stefan: Represented by the 9th House, which begins at 19° Aries. Notably, the sole planetary presence in the 9th is Chiron at 20°25′ Aries. This marks his indicator with a theme of deep vulnerability or unresolved wounds.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. House Placements and Relevant Planetary Dispositions\n • The 7th House (ruling partnerships) contains the Sun (6°34′ Pisces), Mercury (19°15′ Pisces), and Saturn (20°11′ Pisces). Their presence emphasizes a structure of relationships and communication—however, note that the querent’s main focus in this chart is outside the direct arena of committed unions.\n • The 9th House is signified solely by Chiron in Aries, denoting that the area representing Stefan is imbued with a wound or a sensitive, perhaps defensive, energy.\n • Mars, the traditional mover toward action and communication, is in the 11th House at 17°01′ Cancer. Although Mars here could suggest social engagement, its square aspect to Chiron (orb 3°) becomes a key tension factor.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. Major Aspects Impacting the Inquiry\n • Mars Square Chiron (orb 3°): This aspect consistently stands out. It indicates a blockage in the drive for communication—an energy misalignment between the impulse (Mars) and the vulnerabilities (Chiron) linked to the 9th House. The presence of this square is a strong indicator of friction and delay. It suggests that Stefan’s energy is currently mired in internal conflicts or unresolved issues, obstructing clear movement.\n • Mercury Trine Mars (orb 2°): While this aspect typically favors communication, its positive influence is overruled by the disruptive Mars–Chiron square.\n • T-Square involving the Ascendant (querent), MC (23°32′ Taurus), and IC (23°32′ Scorpio) with Uranus on the MC (23°32′ Taurus): This configuration manifests as high tension between personal identity and external demands. The involvement of Uranus implies unpredictability and abrupt changes. Such a setup does not support a steady, planned communication but rather hints at intermittent, erratic events.\n • Additional supportive aspects (sextiles between Moon, Saturn, and Uranus) offer structural integrity to the chart but do not neutralize the overriding tension flagged by Mars square Chiron and the T-square.\n • Venus Square Mars (orb 7°): This aspect, though not central, underscores further friction related to interpersonal dynamics and adds to the overall intensity of conflict in matters of connection.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. Configurations and Chart Shape\n • The presence of a Grand Trine and Castle pattern in the lower quadrants hints at latent potential for resolution through structured progress. However, these are counterbalanced by the T-square configuration, which injects large doses of unpredictability and tension.\n • The bowl shape of the chart, with most planets in the upper right quadrant, emphasizes an outward focus – yet it is undermined by the disruptive factors affecting the area that represents the foreign/other (9th House).\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. Timing Indicators\n • The Moon, positioned at 26° Capricorn (in the 5th House), is involved in multiple sextile and trine aspects (with the IC, MC, Saturn, and Uranus). In a horary context, the Moon’s condition helps gauge the emotional climate and timing of events. However, its current placement does not offer a direct, rapid activation of the 9th House indicator.\n • There is no clear timing marker—no decisive ingress or fast-moving aspect with Chiron—to indicate a near-future contact. The overall influence suggests delays and a state of unresolved tension that can extend indefinitely.\n\n────────────────────────────\n6. Summary of the Chart’s Message (Based Solely on Data)\n • The central tension is between the action-oriented energy (Mars) and the wounded, sensitive indicator in the 9th House (Chiron). This square clearly projects an obstruction to smooth or prompt communication from Stefan.\n • Supplementary configurations (the T-square and Venus square Mars) reinforce unpredictable, conflict-laden energy.\n • The structural elements (Grand Trine, Castle) indicate that while there is an underlying framework that could eventually allow contact, it is severely compromised by the prevailing disruptive aspects.\n • No unambiguous, swift timing marker is present. Instead, the combined energies point to a scenario where any contact from Stefan is either significantly delayed or occurs only under highly volatile conditions.\n\n────────────────────────────\n7. Factual Findings\n • Stefan’s sphere (9th House: Chiron in Aries) shows vulnerability and ongoing wounds.\n • The obstruction posed by the Mars–Chiron square indicates that Stefan’s energy is mired in unresolved conflict.\n • The T-square configuration signals a pattern of unpredictable, disruptive influences.\n • No positive, clear timing indicator (such as a rapid-moving Moon aspect directly activating the 9th House) is evident.\n • Overall, the chart does not endorse the likelihood of contact occurring in the near term. If contact is to occur in your lifetime, it will come after significant internal and energetic reorganization—likely in a moment marked by heightened tension rather than calm resolution.\n\n────────────────────────────\nThe factual data derived from the chart, taken without softening any negative aspects, indicates that the energy presently surrounding Stefan (as represented by Chiron in the 9th House) is in a state of conflict and disarray, with significant delays implied by the disruptive aspects. If contact is to happen, it would be under conditions that involve the resolution—or at least the temporary management—of this tension, meaning that no clear or favorable timeframe is currently set.\n\nReview these data-driven elements carefully, and document them for your interpretation before moving forward with any further inquiry or ritual adjustment.","gen_started":"2025-02-24T22:51:49.613Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-24T22:52:44.385Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa, here is the step‐by‐step factual analysis based solely on the horary chart data you provided.
