Current Situation Indicators:\n- Saturn in your 1st house perfectly reflects your current divorce timing (February 14th)\n- Venus conjunct Neptune in your 1st house shows the amicable nature of your separation and maintaining friendship with your ex\n- The Bowl pattern in the bottom left quadrant now clearly represents your life's transformation\n\n2. Stefan & Future Partnership:\n- The 7th house (partnerships) in Virgo suggests a practical, service-oriented partner\n- Venus-Neptune conjunction speaks to a romantic connection that began abroad (Munich)\n- Mars in Cancer in the 5th house now clearly represents Stefan's two daughters\n\n3. Living Space Requirements:\ntaps the chart emphatically\n\nMy dear, with this context, the chart screams \"YES\" to the larger house. Here's why:\n- Jupiter near the IC (4th house cusp) suggests blending families\n- The water dominance shows emotional bonds forming with Stefan's children\n- The Mutable dominance indicates adaptability needed for merging families\n\nleans forward, speaking in hushed tones\n\nThe timing is crucial here. With Mars retrograde in the 5th house of children, there will be a period of adjustment with Stefan's daughters. The 3-bedroom option would provide necessary space for this family integration.\n\nWould you like me to delve deeper into any specific aspect of this interpretation?"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 1, 2025 9:06am","gen_started":"2025-02-01T14:06:01.935Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-01T14:06:12.188Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
