The chart must be read exactly as it presents itself, without bias in either direction. If the aspects show negativity, that negativity will be revealed fully. If the aspects show positivity, that positivity will be revealed fully. There shall be no softening of negative aspects, nor any dampening of positive ones. The only acceptable outcome is to interpret precisely what the chart demonstrates through its aspects, houses, and planetary positions - be that wonderful, terrible, or anywhere in between. Complete accuracy to the chart's true message is the sole priority.\n\nAlso, please do not immediately assume that I'm looking for romantic inclinations. I am not certain what, if any, feelings exist, and what those feelings are deemed to be. That is the reason I have drawn up the chart, is to get a true determination. So, any biasing towards romantic inclination or otherwise should be removed, and ensure that this chart is interpreted fully and objectively to discern the true nature of the questied's feelings, thoughts, and intentions.\n\nPlease start by listing all relevant chart data for interpretation (ie. transits, aspects, patterns, etc.) from the horary chart using horary principles only.

The following step-by-step extraction and evaluation detail the key themes, tensions, and indicators regarding Suzanne’s genuine thoughts, feelings, and intentions:\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. Data Extraction Summary\n\n• Planetary Positions\n – Sun at 0°25′ Pisces: Indicates a mutable, sensitive, and sometimes elusive sense of identity or will directed by empathy.\n – Moon at 9°53′ Scorpio in the 4th House (home/emotional security): Deep, intense emotions pivotal to inner life; a propensity for secretive, transformative feeling states.\n – Mercury at 8°01′ Pisces in the 8th House: Intuitive, imaginative thinking that may struggle to convey clarity; thoughts are steeped in emotion and the unseen.\n – Venus at 8°29′ Aries in the 9th House and conjunct the MC: A direct, impulsive energy in affections and aesthetic response, expressed publicly; there is a drive toward immediacy and assertiveness.\n – Mars at 17°11′ Cancer (retrograde) in the 12th House: Indicates suppressed aggression or frustrations; an energy directed inward, possibly manifesting as hesitation or hidden resentment.\n – Jupiter at 11°37′ Gemini in the 11th House: Expansive, communicative energy influencing social networks; mental adaptability that brings variety but also scattered focus.\n – Saturn at 19°27′ Pisces in the 9th House: A need for structure and discipline in the domain of ideals and beliefs; may lend weight to emotional burdens through responsibilities.\n – Uranus at 23°25′ Taurus in the 11th House: Introduces sudden, unpredictable influences in social or network interactions; a disruptive, innovative aspect.\n – Neptune at 28°31′ Pisces in the 9th House, in its rulership, and in close conjunction with the North Node: A heightened influence of idealism, dreams, illusions, and potential self-deception regarding deeper intentions.\n – Pluto at 2°36′ Aquarius in the 7th House (opposite Ascendant): Transformation and power dynamics in one-to-one relationships; underlying intensity and potential for control issues.\n – Chiron at 20°08′ Aries in the 10th House: Wounding in the realm of personal purpose or public image, where healing may be sought through direct assertions of self despite vulnerability.\n – North Node at 28°54′ Pisces (retrograde) in the 9th House: A karmic pull towards compassion but with a reflective, inward motion that may obscure clarity.\n – Angular Relationships:\n  • Ascendant at 29°28′ Cancer;\n  • MC at 12°56′ Aries;\n  • IC at 12°56′ Libra.\n\n• Major Aspects (with key orbs):\n – MC Opposition IC (0° orb): Reflects a fundamental polarity between public expression and private emotional states.\n – Neptune Conjunction North Node (0° orb): Emphasizes a blending of spiritual idealism and fate, suggesting aspects of illusion or self-deception in personal values.\n – Jupiter Sextile MC and Trine IC (orbs ≈1°): Indicates supportive, if somewhat superficial, expansion in both public themes and core emotional underpinnings.\n – North Node and Neptune Trine Ascendant (orbs ≈1°): A gentle, fated alignment enhancing the projection of forgiving and empathetic qualities.\n – Moon Trine Mercury (1°): Offers some fluidity between deep emotions and thought, though colored by Piscean vagueness.\n – Mars Trine Saturn (2°): Suggests a capacity to channel internal frustration constructively, yet it exists against undertones of inner conflict.\n – Venus Sextile Jupiter (≈3°): Implies a tendency toward generosity and a perhaps overoptimistic view of relational potentials.\n – Mars Square Chiron (3°): Highlights tension between suppressed anger/frustration and deep-seated wounds; this may manifest as self-directed blame or unspoken hurt.\n – Mercury Square Jupiter (3°): Points to an inclination to overreach in communication, risking exaggeration or misinterpretation of true intentions.\n – Pluto Opposition Ascendant (3°): Underlines transformative, power-laden dynamics in personal interactions.\n – Venus Opposition IC (4°): Indicates a conflict between personal affections and the secure, private inner world.\n – Venus Conjunction MC (4°): Reinforces that her approach to relationships carries both passion and a public assertion of values.\n – Saturn Sextile Uranus (4°): A blending of traditional structure with sudden, unconventional impulses, possibly causing internal ambivalence.\n – Mars and IC, Mars and MC Squares (≈5°): Reflect challenges in reconciling inner desires (or hidden hostilities) with external expressions; tensions may emerge as unpredictable bursts.\n – Uranus aspects to Ascendant and Neptune, and Mars Sextile Uranus (6°): Provide brief moments of innovation or sudden shifts in mood.\n – Venus Sextile Pluto (6°): Offers an opportunity for deep transformation in value systems—possibly a drive to embrace intense relational change.\n – Moon Square Pluto (7°) and Sun Square Uranus (7°): Signal disruptive, even wrenching emotional turbulence and tendencies toward abrupt insights or shocks.\n – Chiron’s aspects (Opposition IC and Conjunction MC at 8°): Further emphasize public versus private wounding; her expressed persona may mask deeper unresolved pains.\n – Moon Trine Mars (8°): Provides a fleeting supportive link between emotional drive and assertive energy, albeit overshadowed by other discordances.\n\n• Identified Patterns\n – T‑Square: Involving the MC (12° Aries), Mars in Cancer, and IC (12° Libra) with Chiron in Aries as a key mediator—emphasizes an ongoing tension between personal expression, hidden aggression, and emotional security.\n – Yod: Composed of the Moon in Scorpio, MC in Aries, and Jupiter in Gemini with Venus in Aries as an important factor—suggests a fated, though challenging, alignment driving evolution in relational themes.\n\n• Special Features and House Emphases\n – Dominant Water Element among the inner planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Saturn, North Node) points to intense, sensitive, and often elusive emotional communication.\n – Cardinal mode prevalence underscores a self-initiating, albeit conflicted, drive within her personal energy.\n – Distribution in the top right quadrant emphasizes issues of public persona and interpersonal relations.\n – With Venus and Chiron on the MC and key aspects to the IC, public versus private expressions of affection and woundedness are central to her relational dynamics.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. Nuanced Contextual Analysis\n\nA. Fundamental Nature of Suzanne’s Thoughts and Communications\n • The combination of Mercury in Pisces and Moon in Scorpio indicates that Suzanne’s internal dialogue is richly intuitive and steeped in emotional complexity.\n • However, Mercury’s square with Jupiter warns of a tendency to overstate or misinterpret her own feelings, leading to internal contradictions in her thought process.\n • The presence of Neptune in rulership with its close tie to the North Node further colors her thought with idealism and potential illusion—she might be influenced by what she wishes to see rather than what is objectively clear.\n\nB. The Nature and Quality of Her Emotions\n • The Scorpio Moon in the fourth house suggests that her emotional life runs deep, with hidden currents that may include both passionate attractions and unresolved resentments.\n • The opposition between Venus and the IC reinforces an internal dissonance: she experiences a pull between the longing for overt, impulsive connection (Venus in Aries) and a retreat into the privacy and security of her inner self.\n • Mars retrograde in the 12th house and its square to key points (IC and MC) indicate a suppressed or internally conflicted drive—there exists unexpressed anger or hurt that she may not be willing to show openly.\n • Additionally, the T-Square configuration amplifies the conflict between experiencing dynamic public expressions of desire and maintaining a need for inner emotional safety, suggesting that any overt affection is counterbalanced by deep-seated wariness or inner pain.\n\nC. Her Intentions, as Revealed by the Chart\n • With Venus on the MC and in a sextile to Jupiter, there is an indicated readiness to engage on a level that is both assertive and generous, yet this is overlaid by severe internal struggles.\n • The dual pull of the public (MC) and private (IC) spheres shows her intentions are not monolithic; she is likely internally divided between a desire to connect and a self-protective impulse to retreat or react defensively.\n • The influence of Pluto in the 7th House (opposing the Ascendant) adds a transformational, almost fated quality to her relational engagements—connections may be intense, with underlying power dynamics and potential for control or change.\n • The disruptive influence of Uranus (as seen by the Sun square and other aspects) indicates that while there is a momentary spark of attraction or intrigue, her underlying motives could be destabilized by sudden insights or unexpected shifts in mood.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. Relational Signature Determination for Suzanne’s Feelings and Intentions\n\nBased on the precise degree data and aspectual configuration, the following characteristics are evident:\n\n• Thoughts and Communication:\n – Suzanne’s mental landscape is deeply intuitive but clouded by idealism and an internal conflict between dashed expectations and unspoken wishes.\n – There exists a tendency to think in a fluid, even if imprecise, manner—making it challenging for her to articulate clear intentions.\n\n• Emotional Nature and Internal State:\n – Her emotions are intense and transformative but guarded; the Scorpio Moon coupled with Mars retrograde and T-Square tensions suggest that beneath a façade of assertiveness there are layers of vulnerability, suppressed anger, or unresolved wounds.\n – The predominant water energy indicates sensitivity and the potential for both profound attachment and covert suspicion.\n\n• Intentions Toward You:\n – Publicly visible intentions (via the placement of Venus on the MC and supportive aspects from Jupiter) lean toward direct engagement, yet this is complicated by an internal battle between the desire for connection and an instinct to self-protect borne out of inner conflict.\n – There is no unequivocal indication of a purely romantic drive; instead, her intentions appear multifaceted—combining impulses for immediate, perhaps impulsive connection with a retreat into guarded, private emotional spaces.\n – The power dynamics suggested by Pluto’s involvement indicate that any engagement from Suzanne is likely to carry an undercurrent of transformation, where control and intense personal change play crucial roles.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. Final Summation of Suzanne’s Chart Data Relative to the Question\n\n• Suzanne’s true thoughts are colored by an inner dialogue that is both intensely emotional and highly intuitive, yet clouded by idealistic misperceptions and personal vulnerabilities.\n• Her feelings are profound but conflicted—she harbors both an impulsive desire for affection (as indicated by Venus in Aries) and a protective, sometimes repressive, withdrawal triggered by unresolved emotional wounds (evident in Mars retrograde and the T-Square configuration).\n• Her intentions, therefore, are not straightforward: while she may outwardly project a readiness for engagement, the underlying dynamics suggest significant internal tension and ambivalence.\n• In sum, the chart reveals a complex interplay between the desire for connection and the instinct for self-preservation, pointing to intentions that are as much about transforming inner pain as they are about forging any clear relational path.\n\nThe analysis provided adheres strictly to the chart’s data. Further interpretation and discussion should consider these evidentiary points in the context of your query.","gen_started":"2025-02-18T21:58:31.807Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-18T21:59:07.393Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is the methodical analysis of the chart data according to the established horary procedures. The following step-by-step extraction and evaluation detail the key themes, tensions, and indicators regarding Suzanne’s genuine thoughts, feelings, and intentions:\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. Data Extraction Summary\n\n• Planetary Positions\n – Sun at 0°25′ Pisces: Indicates a mutable, sensitive, and sometimes elusive sense of identity or will directed by empathy.\n – Moon at 9°53′ Scorpio in the 4th House (home/emotional security): Deep, intense emotions pivotal to inner life; a propensity for secretive, transformative feeling states.\n – Mercury at 8°01′ Pisces in the 8th House: Intuitive, imaginative thinking that may struggle to convey clarity; thoughts are steeped in emotion and the unseen.\n – Venus at 8°29′ Aries in the 9th House and conjunct the MC: A direct, impulsive energy in affections and aesthetic response, expressed publicly; there is a drive toward immediacy and assertiveness.\n – Mars at 17°11′ Cancer (retrograde) in the 12th House: Indicates suppressed aggression or frustrations; an energy directed inward, possibly manifesting as hesitation or hidden resentment.\n – Jupiter at 11°37′ Gemini in the 11th House: Expansive, communicative energy influencing social networks; mental adaptability that brings variety but also scattered focus.\n – Saturn at 19°27′ Pisces in the 9th House: A need for structure and discipline in the domain of ideals and beliefs; may lend weight to emotional burdens through responsibilities.\n – Uranus at 23°25′ Taurus in the 11th House: Introduces sudden, unpredictable influences in social or network interactions; a disruptive, innovative aspect.\n – Neptune at 28°31′ Pisces in the 9th House, in its rulership, and in close conjunction with the North Node: A heightened influence of idealism, dreams, illusions, and potential self-deception regarding deeper intentions.\n – Pluto at 2°36′ Aquarius in the 7th House (opposite Ascendant): Transformation and power dynamics in one-to-one relationships; underlying intensity and potential for control issues.\n – Chiron at 20°08′ Aries in the 10th House: Wounding in the realm of personal purpose or public image, where healing may be sought through direct assertions of self despite vulnerability.\n – North Node at 28°54′ Pisces (retrograde) in the 9th House: A karmic pull towards compassion but with a reflective, inward motion that may obscure clarity.\n – Angular Relationships:\n  • Ascendant at 29°28′ Cancer;\n  • MC at 12°56′ Aries;\n  • IC at 12°56′ Libra.\n\n• Major Aspects (with key orbs):\n – MC Opposition IC (0° orb): Reflects a fundamental polarity between public expression and private emotional states.\n – Neptune Conjunction North Node (0° orb): Emphasizes a blending of spiritual idealism and fate, suggesting aspects of illusion or self-deception in personal values.\n – Jupiter Sextile MC and Trine IC (orbs ≈1°): Indicates supportive, if somewhat superficial, expansion in both public themes and core emotional underpinnings.\n – North Node and Neptune Trine Ascendant (orbs ≈1°): A gentle, fated alignment enhancing the projection of forgiving and empathetic qualities.\n – Moon Trine Mercury (1°): Offers some fluidity between deep emotions and thought, though colored by Piscean vagueness.\n – Mars Trine Saturn (2°): Suggests a capacity to channel internal frustration constructively, yet it exists against undertones of inner conflict.\n – Venus Sextile Jupiter (≈3°): Implies a tendency toward generosity and a perhaps overoptimistic view of relational potentials.\n – Mars Square Chiron (3°): Highlights tension between suppressed anger/frustration and deep-seated wounds; this may manifest as self-directed blame or unspoken hurt.\n – Mercury Square Jupiter (3°): Points to an inclination to overreach in communication, risking exaggeration or misinterpretation of true intentions.\n – Pluto Opposition Ascendant (3°): Underlines transformative, power-laden dynamics in personal interactions.\n – Venus Opposition IC (4°): Indicates a conflict between personal affections and the secure, private inner world.\n – Venus Conjunction MC (4°): Reinforces that her approach to relationships carries both passion and a public assertion of values.\n – Saturn Sextile Uranus (4°): A blending of traditional structure with sudden, unconventional impulses, possibly causing internal ambivalence.\n – Mars and IC, Mars and MC Squares (≈5°): Reflect challenges in reconciling inner desires (or hidden hostilities) with external expressions; tensions may emerge as unpredictable bursts.\n – Uranus aspects to Ascendant and Neptune, and Mars Sextile Uranus (6°): Provide brief moments of innovation or sudden shifts in mood.\n – Venus Sextile Pluto (6°): Offers an opportunity for deep transformation in value systems—possibly a drive to embrace intense relational change.\n – Moon Square Pluto (7°) and Sun Square Uranus (7°): Signal disruptive, even wrenching emotional turbulence and tendencies toward abrupt insights or shocks.\n – Chiron’s aspects (Opposition IC and Conjunction MC at 8°): Further emphasize public versus private wounding; her expressed persona may mask deeper unresolved pains.\n – Moon Trine Mars (8°): Provides a fleeting supportive link between emotional drive and assertive energy, albeit overshadowed by other discordances.\n\n• Identified Patterns\n – T‑Square: Involving the MC (12° Aries), Mars in Cancer, and IC (12° Libra) with Chiron in Aries as a key mediator—emphasizes an ongoing tension between personal expression, hidden aggression, and emotional security.\n – Yod: Composed of the Moon in Scorpio, MC in Aries, and Jupiter in Gemini with Venus in Aries as an important factor—suggests a fated, though challenging, alignment driving evolution in relational themes.\n\n• Special Features and House Emphases\n – Dominant Water Element among the inner planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Saturn, North Node) points to intense, sensitive, and often elusive emotional communication.\n – Cardinal mode prevalence underscores a self-initiating, albeit conflicted, drive within her personal energy.\n – Distribution in the top right quadrant emphasizes issues of public persona and interpersonal relations.\n – With Venus and Chiron on the MC and key aspects to the IC, public versus private expressions of affection and woundedness are central to her relational dynamics.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2.
