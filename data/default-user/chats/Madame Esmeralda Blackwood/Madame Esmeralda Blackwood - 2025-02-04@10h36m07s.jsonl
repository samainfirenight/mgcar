Additional Timing & Contextual Data\n\n• The Moon is a waxing crescent, a detail that can be significant in horary timing.\n• The chart’s quadrant emphasis (top right empty) suggests matters of public projection may be less involved, shifting focus to personal/internal forces.\n• The distribution of modes and the placement of internal versus external planets have been noted and will be considered in the interpretation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis data should serve as a factual basis for further interpretation.

Planetary Positions\n\n• Sun: 16° 1′ Aquarius\n• Moon: 6° 20′ Taurus\n• Mercury: 12° 26′ Aquarius\n• Venus: 0° 11′ Aries\n• Mars: 19° 28′ Cancer (retrograde)\n• Jupiter: 11° 16′ Gemini\n• Saturn: 17° 49′ Pisces\n• Uranus: 23° 16′ Taurus\n• Neptune: 28° 4′ Pisces\n• Pluto: 2° 10′ Aquarius\n• North Node: 29° 39′ Pisces (retrograde)\n• Chiron: 19° 36′ Aries\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. House Division (Key Houses)\n\n• 1st House: Starts at 23° Pisces – contains Moon, Venus, Neptune, North Node, Chiron\n• 2nd House: Starts at 11° Taurus – contains Uranus\n• 3rd House: Starts at 8° Gemini – contains Jupiter\n• 4th House: Starts at 26° Gemini\n• 5th House: Starts at 14° Cancer – contains Mars\n• 6th House: Starts at 9° Leo      ← (Stefan’s relevant house per your cross-reference, representing his 9th house matter)\n• 7th House: Starts at 23° Virgo\n• 8th House: Starts at 11° Scorpio\n• 9th House: Starts at 8° Sagittarius\n• 10th House: Starts at 26° Sagittarius\n• 11th House: Starts at 14° Capricorn – contains Pluto\n• 12th House: Starts at 9° Aquarius – contains Sun, Mercury, Saturn\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Major Aspects (Selected, as these may be particularly relevant for a horary analysis)\n\n• Uranus Sextile Ascendant   (orb: 0°)\n• Mars Square Chiron      (orb: 0°)\n• MC Opposition IC      (orb: 0°)\n• Neptune Conjunction North Node (orb: 1°)\n• Venus Conjunction North Node  (orb: 1°)\n• Mercury Trine Jupiter     (orb: 1°)\n• Venus Sextile Pluto      (orb: 2°)\n• Neptune Square both IC and MC (orb: 2°)\n• Venus Conjunction Neptune   (orb: 2°)\n• Mars Trine Saturn      (orb: 2°)\n• Pluto Sextile North Node   (orb: 3°)\n• Sun Sextile Chiron      (orb: 3°)\n\n(The chart also contains further aspects with larger orbs, including oppositions and squares—these have been catalogued in the provided data.)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Patterns & Special Configurations\n\n• Stellium in Pisces (encompassing the Ascendant, North Node, Neptune, Saturn – along with Venus’s involvement via aspect)\n• T-Square patterns involving the MC, IC, and North Node (with Neptune and Venus contributing to the configuration)\n• The chart overall forms a Bowl Shape with an emphasis on the bottom left quadrant\n• Matter of numerously recurring Square aspects (total of 13)\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Additional Timing & Contextual Data\n\n• The Moon is a waxing crescent, a detail that can be significant in horary timing.\n• The chart’s quadrant emphasis (top right empty) suggests matters of public projection may be less involved, shifting focus to personal/internal forces.\n• The distribution of modes and the placement of internal versus external planets have been noted and will be considered in the interpretation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nThis data should serve as a factual basis for further interpretation. Please review these details to ensure all necessary points are documented before proceeding with the interpretative phase."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 4, 2025 10:40am","gen_started":"2025-02-04T15:40:30.581Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T15:40:57.607Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}
