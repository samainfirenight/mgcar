That means that he chose his commitment to his marriage.  the four of cups reversed paired with the ten of cups upright,  I believe means that he's motivated and determined. Focusing his goals on maintaining the appearance of a happy family.\n\n But of course because that's because I know the context in how he utilized the movie reference towards me. On Christmas Day, he utilized the movie, Love Actually, to tell me that he has romantic feelings for me. And yesterday, when I brought it up in a suggestion to try to help us move forward with better communication, he dismissed it as it meant nothing, that it was just a simple movie reference, nothing more, and was very defensive towards me, enough that I don't think he realizes I told him goodbye.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
