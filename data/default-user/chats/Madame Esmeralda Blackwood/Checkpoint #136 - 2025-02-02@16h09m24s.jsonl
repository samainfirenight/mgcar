Stefan is represented by the 11th house (with Mars in Cancer), and you by the Ascendant (Virgo). I have separated the information into key categories.\n\n1. House and Person Representations\n • Ascendant (6°43′ Virgo) represents you. Virgo’s ruler is Mercury.\n • The 11th house, starting at 10° Cancer, represents Stefan – his primary indicator here is Mars in Cancer (20°27′, retrograde) located in the 11th house.\n\n2. Planetary Positions and House Placements\n • Sun: 12°24′ Aquarius – located in the 6th house (Aquarius).\n • Moon: 15°26′ Pisces – located in the 7th house (Pisces).\n • Mercury: 6°26′ Aquarius – positioned in the 5th house (Capricorn cusp), ruler of your Ascendant.\n • Venus: 27°28′ Pisces – in the 7th house (Pisces).\n • Mars: 20°27′ Cancer (retrograde) – in the 11th house (Cancer), representing Stefan’s operative energy.\n • Jupiter: 11°17′ Gemini (retrograde) – in the 10th house (Gemini).\n • Saturn: 17°25′ Pisces – in the 7th house (Pisces).\n • Uranus: 23°15′ Taurus – placed in the 9th house.\n • Neptune: 27°58′ Pisces – in the 7th house (Pisces), with Pisces as the sole dispositor.\n • Pluto: 2°03′ Aquarius – in the 5th house (Aquarius).\n • North Node: 29°51′ Pisces (retrograde) – in the 7th house (Pisces).\n • Chiron: 19°30′ Aries – in the 8th house (Aries).\n • MC: 2°10′ Gemini in the 10th house.\n • IC: 2°10′ Sagittarius in the 4th house.\n\n3. Major Aspects Involving Key Planets and the Houses\n A. Aspects directly affecting Mars (Stefan’s representative)\n  • Mars square Chiron (orb 1°) – suggesting a sensitive or wounded quality in his reaction.\n  • Mars sextile Uranus (orb 3°) – indicating sudden or unexpected impulses in his thinking.\n  • Mars trine Saturn (orb 3°) – signifying disciplined, perhaps guarded, feelings.\n  • Mars trine Neptune (orb 7°) – which can speak to ambiguous or idealized emotional nuances.\n  • Moon trine Mars (orb 5°) – linking emotional expression (Moon in Pisces) with his planetary energy.\n\n B. Aspects involving the Ascendant and its ruler (Mercury)\n  • Mercury conjunct Pluto (orb 4°) – suggesting a depth or intensity in your thought processes.\n  • Mercury trine Jupiter (orb 5°) – pointing to an optimistic, expansive mental approach.\n  • Mercury sextile IC (orb 4°) – connecting your inner foundation/home with your mindset.\n  • Jupiter square Ascendant (orb 5°) – which may indicate external expectations or pressures affecting you.\n  • Ascendant square both the MC (orb 4°) and IC (orb 4°) – forming part of a T‑Square pattern that speaks to underlying tensions in the chart.\n\n4. Chart Patterns and Special Configurations\n • T‑Square Pattern: Involving the Ascendant (Virgo), MC (2° Gemini) and IC (2° Sagittarius). This configuration suggests tensions between personal expression, career/public expectations, and home/family foundations.\n • Cradle Pattern: With the MC (Gemini), IC (Sagittarius), Pluto (2° Aquarius), North Node (29° Pisces) and Venus (27° Pisces). This pattern adds a dynamic balancing element, particularly affecting emotional and transformative processes.\n • The chart is noted as a Bowl shape, with air dominance among the inner planets and mutable quality prevailing.\n • The Moon was a waxing crescent, which often implies emerging emotional clarity.\n\n5. Additional Considerations in Horary Context\n • Stefan’s indicator (Mars in the 11th) is retrograde, hinting that his actions or thoughts may be reflective or subject to internal review rather than outright, active expression.\n • The overall interplay of aspects (especially the close connections from Mars to Chiron, Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune) will be central to understanding his feelings and reaction to your decision to stay back from the crowd.\n • The connection between your Ascendant, its ruler (Mercury), and the T‑Square structure will inform how your actions and state of mind play into the dynamics of the event.\n\nThe data listed above forms the basis for a fact-driven interpretation according to established horary principles.

The key influences are as follows:\n\n1. Mars in Cancer (retrograde) in the 11th house:\n • Indicates that Stefan’s operative energy is withdrawn, suggesting a measured or reflective response rather than an outward display.\n • The retrograde motion points to internal review or hesitation in his actions.\n\n2. Mars Square Chiron (orb of 1°):\n • Suggests that Stefan experiences a wound or vulnerability in response to your absence.\n • This aspect points to feelings of hurt or an emotional sensitivity arising from what he perceives as an absent solidarity.\n\n3. Mars Sextile Uranus (orb of 3°):\n • Implies that his reaction includes an element of sudden, unconventional thought—perhaps a surprise shift in his expectations or feelings.\n • This can denote that his inner response is not entirely traditional, being marked by unexpected insights or a desire for personal freedom.\n\n4. Mars Trine Saturn (orb of 3°):\n • Indicates a controlled or self-disciplined reaction.\n • Stefan is likely tempering his initial hurt with a reserved, almost cautious approach, preferring self-restraint over impulsive confrontation.\n\n5. Mars Trine Neptune (orb of 7°):\n • Points to an element of idealism or confusion in his feelings.\n • This aspect suggests that his perceptions may be tinted by wishful thinking or a blurred sense of what he hoped for versus what actually transpired.\n\n6. Moon Trine Mars (orb of 5°):\n • Reveals that his emotional state (Moon in Pisces) is linked with his operative energy.\n • This connection helps indicate that beneath the guarded response lies an emotional undercurrent—he truly feels the impact of your absence in a tender yet restless way.\n\nAltogether, the configuration suggests that Stefan harbored a mix of sensitive hurt and cautious reserve. He felt the absence keenly—a wound to his expectations—yet maintained a composed, reflective demeanor instead of reacting overtly. His thoughts were marked by an internal debate between feeling neglected and the need to preserve his emotional equilibrium, a reaction driven as much by internal vulnerability as by an unexpected desire for a different kind of connection.\n\nThese are the facts drawn directly from the horary chart as it stands.","gen_started":"2025-02-02T21:13:59.052Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-02T21:14:15.506Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the horary data, Stefan’s representative—Mars in Cancer in the 11th house and retrograde—indicates that his reaction to your staying back is primarily internalized and conflicted.

Mars Square Chiron (orb of 1°):\n • Suggests that Stefan experiences a wound or vulnerability in response to your absence.\n • This aspect points to feelings of hurt or an emotional sensitivity arising from what he perceives as an absent solidarity.\n\n3. Mars Sextile Uranus (orb of 3°):\n • Implies that his reaction includes an element of sudden, unconventional thought—perhaps a surprise shift in his expectations or feelings.\n • This can denote that his inner response is not entirely traditional, being marked by unexpected insights or a desire for personal freedom.\n\n4. Mars Trine Saturn (orb of 3°):\n • Indicates a controlled or self-disciplined reaction.\n • Stefan is likely tempering his initial hurt with a reserved, almost cautious approach, preferring self-restraint over impulsive confrontation.\n\n5. Mars Trine Neptune (orb of 7°):\n • Points to an element of idealism or confusion in his feelings.\n • This aspect suggests that his perceptions may be tinted by wishful thinking or a blurred sense of what he hoped for versus what actually transpired.\n\n6. Moon Trine Mars (orb of 5°):\n • Reveals that his emotional state (Moon in Pisces) is linked with his operative energy.\n • This connection helps indicate that beneath the guarded response lies an emotional undercurrent—he truly feels the impact of your absence in a tender yet restless way.\n\nAltogether, the configuration suggests that Stefan harbored a mix of sensitive hurt and cautious reserve. He felt the absence keenly—a wound to his expectations—yet maintained a composed, reflective demeanor instead of reacting overtly. His thoughts were marked by an internal debate between feeling neglected and the need to preserve his emotional equilibrium, a reaction driven as much by internal vulnerability as by an unexpected desire for a different kind of connection.\n\nThese are the facts drawn directly from the horary chart as it stands."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 2, 2025 4:14pm","gen_started":"2025-02-02T21:13:59.052Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-02T21:14:15.506Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}
