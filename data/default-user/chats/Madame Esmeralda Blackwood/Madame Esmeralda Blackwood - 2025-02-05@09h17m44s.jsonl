Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Is Stefan planning to enter into a romantic relationship with the person he was communicating with at 3:34 a.m. his local time?\n\n1. Page of Cups Upright\n2. The star reversed.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
