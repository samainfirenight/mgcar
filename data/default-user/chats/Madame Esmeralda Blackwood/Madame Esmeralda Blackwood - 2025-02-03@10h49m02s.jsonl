Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\n I've done this reading in two separate draws, because the first draw, I believe, was corrupted. I caught myself focusing on the aesthetics of the question that I had printed onto my screen, because there were indiscretions that my eyes couldn't unsee. And although I refocused my attention every time I caught myself doing it, I believe it could have potentially corrupted the first draw.\n\n For the second draw, I corrected those visual aesthetics in my question and maintained clear focus throughout the entire draw.\n\nHere is the question I asked: Will Stefan initiate contact with me during the window between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM EST today?\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\tCard Draw One\n\t</summary>\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - five of wands reversed\n  - king of swords reversed\n\n1. death reversed\n2. eight of cups reversed\n3. knight of cups reversed\n4. seven of swords reversed\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\tCard Draw Two\n\t</summary>\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - wheel of fortune upright\n  \n1. temperance upright\n2. hanged man upright\n3. knight of cups upright\n4. two of swords upright\n\n</details>","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bookmark_link":"Checkpoint #153 - 2025-02-03@10h56m22s"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
