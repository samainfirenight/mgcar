Additional data noted from the chart details:\n • The chart has a Bowl shape, and the fixed modality predominates among the inner planets.\n • The bottom right quadrant is empty, with most planets located in the top left quadrant.\n • The Moon is rising; Pluto is on the Midheaven, while Mars and the IC align on the Nadir.\n • The sextile aspect appears most frequently (10 occurrences in the chart).\n • Neptune in Pisces is in its own rulership, which further emphasizes its influence.\n\nThis list compiles the raw, factual data from your horary chart that will serve as the foundation for subsequent interpretation.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T16:18:39.922Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T16:19:04.537Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a summary list of the key horary chart components for this question, extracted directly from your provided data and organized using horary principles.

Notable chart patterns and configurations:\n • T-Square Pattern:\n  – Involving MC at 23° Capricorn, Chiron at 19° Aries, and IC at 23° Cancer with Mars at 19° Cancer.\n • Cradle Configuration (two instances identified):\n  – One includes Mars at 19° Cancer, MC at 23° Capricorn, Neptune at 28° Pisces, Uranus at 23° Taurus, and IC at 23° Cancer.\n  – A second involves Mars at 19° Cancer, MC at 23° Capricorn, Saturn at 17° Pisces, Uranus at 23° Taurus, and IC at 23° Cancer.\n\n5. Additional data noted from the chart details:\n • The chart has a Bowl shape, and the fixed modality predominates among the inner planets.\n • The bottom right quadrant is empty, with most planets located in the top left quadrant.\n • The Moon is rising; Pluto is on the Midheaven, while Mars and the IC align on the Nadir.\n • The sextile aspect appears most frequently (10 occurrences in the chart).\n • Neptune in Pisces is in its own rulership, which further emphasizes its influence.\n\nThis list compiles the raw, factual data from your horary chart that will serve as the foundation for subsequent interpretation."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 4, 2025 11:19am","gen_started":"2025-02-04T16:18:39.922Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T16:19:04.537Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}
