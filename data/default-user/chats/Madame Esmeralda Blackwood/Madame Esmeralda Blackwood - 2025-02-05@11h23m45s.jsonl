House Indicators:\n • You, as querent, are represented by the Ascendant in 14° Taurus.\n • Suzanne occupies the role of the 4th house (starting at 24° Cancer) corresponding to Stefan’s 7th house.\n • Stefan is indicated by the Ascendant’s 9th house (from 7° Capricorn to 24° Capricorn). In this chart no luminary or personal planet is present in this sector, suggesting a lack of active, foreign-oriented or extra-relationship influence.\n\n2. Planetary Activity:\n • The absence of significant planetary activation in the 9th house suggests that circumstances reflective of an extramarital liaison do not show current dynamic motion. Stefan’s extramarital indicator appears dormant.\n • The multiple planet square involving Mercury (14° Aquarius), the Ascendant (14° Taurus), the Moon (21° Taurus), Sun (17° Aquarius), and Uranus (23° Taurus) highlights tensions in matters of communication and personal identity that affect the querent’s present state.\n • The strong Mercury square Ascendant (orb: 0°) may point to difficult or conflicting exchanges in the immediate environment, further underscoring issues within your current relationships rather than an external affair.\n\n3.

The acute focus of Mars at 19° Cancer personally stresses domestic or foundational issues rather than external liaisons.\n • The prominence of sextiles (the most frequent aspect) indicates potential opportunities for resolution, yet no sextile or major aspect activates the 9th house’s cusp or its related significator for Stefan. This further diminishes the likelihood of an extramarital situation.\n\n4. Additional Notes:\n • With the Moon (a sensitive indicator of relationship dynamics) well placed in Taurus and involved in favorable aspects (sextiles with Mars and the IC), the focus of emotional energy appears tied to the established, primary connections.\n • The chart’s overall shape—a Bowl, combined with a dominant Fixed quality among inner planets—emphasizes stability and resistance to sudden external changes. An affair in progress would typically be marked by more disruptive, volatile influences, especially in the house representing Stefan’s extramarital affairs.\n\nBased on these specific elements – the lack of activation in the 9th house representing Stefan, the tensions observable primarily within the communication and domestic domains, and the patterns favoring established structures – the indication is that there is no present extramarital affair active for Stefan with anyone beyond the bounds of the current relationships.","gen_started":"2025-02-05T16:26:46.364Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T16:27:01.919Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Analyzing the chart for your question – “Is Stefan currently involved in an extramarital affair with someone other than you or Suzanne?” – the following observations arise from the horary details using strict horary principles:\n\n1.
