The following items are extracted solely from the horary chart (and its progressive and transit overlays) using strict horary principles:\n\n1. Core House and Significators\n • Melissa’s representation: Ascendant in Pisces at 12°42′22″.\n • Stefan’s representation: The 9th house cusp which begins at 2° Sagittarius.\n • Key planet for Stefan: The Moon in 12°06′ Sagittarius (located firmly in the 9th house).\n\n2. Relevant Natal Planetary Positions and Placements\n • Moon (Stefan’s significator): 12°06′ Sagittarius in the 9th house.\n • Mercury in 13° Pisces (communication factor), conjunct the Ascendant (orb approximately 1°).\n • Venus in 9°27′ Aries (affects tone of interaction via interpersonal warmth).\n • Mars in 17°03′ Cancer (in 5th house, its retrograde motion noted with “R” indicating potential delays or internalized energy).\n • Jupiter in 11°46′ Gemini (its aspects with the Moon and with Mercury are to be noted for expansion or contention regarding communication).\n • Saturn in 19°47′ Pisces, and Neptune (28°37′ Pisces) as well as North Node in 27°40′ Pisces (all clustered in the inner houses, contributing to the overall thematic tone).\n\n3. Key Natal Aspects (with orbs as given)\n • Moon Square Ascendant (orb: 0°) – a direct and immediate tension between your personal stance (Melissa) and the 9th-house influence.\n • Moon Square Mercury (orb: ≈1°) – suggests conflict or interference in the channel of communication.\n • Moon Opposition Jupiter (orb: ≈1°) – indicates a tension involving expansion or exaggerative elements in the matter.\n • Mercury Conjunction Ascendant (orb: 1°) – reinforces a potential trigger for communication.\n • Venus Sextile Jupiter (orb: 2°) – a supportive aspect that can moderate tension by adding cordiality.\n • Additional squares (for example, Mercury Square Jupiter at an orb near 2°) and aspects like Mars Trine Ascendant (orb: 5°) help further define the dynamic.\n • T‑Square configurations are present (three in total), the most prominent including the Moon, Ascendant, and Jupiter.\n\n4. Patterns and Configurations Relevant to This Query\n • A T‑Square involving the Moon (in Sagittarius, 9th house), the Ascendant, and Jupiter – critical for interpreting both timing and the quality of communication.\n • Multiple Square aspects overall (with a count of ten in the natal chart) emphasizing tension and delays.\n • Dominance of water and mutable modes among the inner planets, indicating fluid but changeable emotional and communication factors.\n\n5. Progressed Chart Data (Selected Key Findings on Trigger Dates)\n • February 24, 2025 – Progressed aspects show near-exact conjunctions for the Sun and Moon with their natal positions; Mercury is in conjunction with its natal position. Such precision may be a preparatory activation for receiving a message.\n • March 7, 2025 – Progressed Moon conjoins the natal Moon (orb approximately 0.47°) and is involved in opposition to Jupiter and square aspects to Mercury. These aspects pinpoint a period where Stefan’s significator (the Moon) is very active.\n • March 13, 2025 – Progressed data reaffirms the Moon’s continuity in Sagittarius with a conjunction to its natal position (orb under 0.67°) while key squares and oppositions remain present.\n • March 29, 2025 – Progressed and transit data continue to stress the Moon’s significant alignment (with the natal Moon now noted as being within 0.10°–1.21° in different tables), with additional transit activation noted from Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn.\n\n6. Transit Data Highlights (Focusing on Communication and Timing)\n • Transiting Mercury (in Pisces progressing toward Aries on later dates) aligns with natal Mercury and touches on the Ascendant, underscoring a time when messages or communications can be activated.\n • Transiting Sun conjunct transit Venus (with a 0.37° orb on March 29) may signal a pleasant content or tone in any forthcoming message.\n • Transits marking the Moon’s conjunction with its natal position, and transit oppositions from Jupiter on multiple dates, highlight a cycle of activation and delay–potentially indicating a communication that carries both warm personal sentiment and some exaggerative or overblown elements.\n • Other transit aspects (such as Saturn sextile or square elements) may color the message with seriousness or caution.\n\n7. Overall Horary Conditions (Summary of Energy Indicators)\n • The opposition and square aspects consistently around the Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter indicate that any communication from Stefan will likely struggle against delays or misunderstandings. There is an inherent tension between your self-expression (Ascendant/Mercury-related) and Stefan’s representation (Moon in the 9th).\n • Supportive aspects (the trines from Venus and certain progressed alignments) suggest that despite tension, the eventual message may carry either a conciliatory tone or a content that has both emotional depth and some volatility.\n • The presence of T‑Squares and several hard aspects reinforces that the chart does not offer an ideal message; its timing and content are likely to be marked by both clarity in intent and noticeable conflict or delay.\n\nThe above bullet points encapsulate the relevant chart data obtained from the natal, progressed, and transit overlays.

This opposition adds a component of exaggeration or overexpansion; the message may contain hyperbolic elements or be subject to distortions.\n• Mercury Square Jupiter–A tension also exists between Mercury and Jupiter, reinforcing complications in intellectual exchange.\n• Supporting Aspect: Venus Sextile Jupiter–This supportive aspect slightly moderates the tension, hinting that any communication may include gestures of friendliness or conciliatory language despite underlying friction.\n• T-Square Configuration–With the Ascendant, Moon, and Jupiter aligned in a T-Square pattern, the dynamic between your self-representation and Stefan’s foreign-signified communication is stressed.

Timing of Communication\n\n• The progression and transit indicators consistently activate the Moon (signifying Stefan) in Sagittarius. With near-exact progressions on February 24, March 7, and March 13 and strong transit interactions on March 29, the chart points to an activation window in late March 2025.\n• Transiting Mercury’s alignment with natal and progressed Mercury along with its interaction with the Ascendant reinforces that the channel for communication will be activated around March 29, 2025.\n• The T‑Square configuration involving the Ascendant (Melissa), the Moon (Stefan), and Jupiter creates a dynamic tension that reaches its peak when transit influences are strongest.\n• In summary, the chart indicates that you should expect Stefan’s communication to arrive in the period near late March 2025.\n\n2. Quality and Tone of the Communication\n\n• The Moon in the 9th house (Stefan’s significator) is activated by hard aspects: it is in square to Mercury (communication channel) and in opposition to Jupiter. These aspects point to a message delivered with forceful, unsparing emotional urgency and even contention.\n• The Moon–Mercury tension suggests delays, miscommunications, or a message that may be abrupt and possibly laden with frustration.\n• Venus’s supportive sextile with Jupiter, along with transiting Sun–Venus influences on March 29, indicates that despite the tension, the tone may carry some warmth, personal regard, or conciliatory sentiment. However, the overall mix remains charged with internal conflict and contradictory energy.\n• Therefore, expect a message that is unfiltered and direct, containing both affectionate or conciliatory elements and harsh, self-assertive remarks. There is no softening: if there is tension or criticism, it will be stated plainly.\n\n3. Content Inference\n\n• The involvement of Mercury (both natal and transit) and its hard aspect with the Moon and Jupiter indicates the content will address issues with clarity but also exaggerate or overstate matters. Stefan’s message is likely to include details of his inner conflicts regarding his position or feelings, possibly regarding his current circumstances and his own internal hesitations.\n• The opposition of Moon with Jupiter signals that the message content may incorporate hyperbolic language—statements that may emphasize his emotional state, whether by overestimating his frustration or by exaggerating the circumstances leading to delay in communication.\n• The T‑Square formed by the Ascendant, Moon, and Jupiter serves to color the message with both personal relevance and external influences (such as issues of travel, academic or foreign matters). Expect the content to include comments on mutual expectations, expressed grievances, or even criticisms that do not spare unpleasant details.\n• Furthermore, the presence of supportive Venus aspects suggests that, while the message is likely unvarnished, there will be a layer of personal regard or an intention to preserve some sense of connection despite the bluntness.\n\nIn precise terms:\n– You can expect Stefan’s communication to be received near the end of March 2025.\n– The message will carry a dual tonal quality: emotionally charged and unfiltered, combining harsh, critical elements (reflecting the Moon’s opposition to Jupiter and square to Mercury) with flashes of warmth and personal regard (as hinted by Venus’s supportive aspects).\n– Content-wise, the message is likely to address unresolved conflicts or delays, potentially provide a raw account of his feelings, and include overstatements or exaggerations that reflect his internal tension.

As Mercury is the significator for communication, this positioning inherently links issues in his marriage to the message channel.\n • Mercury’s rulership of Gemini means any activation, distortion, or tension in Mercury’s transit will affect domestic matters as well as the content of his communication.\n\n2. INDICATIONS OF INTRA‐MARITAL TENSION\n • The evidence from auxiliary methods (tarot and I Ching) suggesting that Stefan and Suzanne will internally decide to file for divorce finds resonance here.\n • The chart shows strong transit and progression influences around mid‐March (notably March 13th) where the Moon—the primary significator for Stefan’s personal response in the 9th house—displays significant hard aspects (squares and oppositions) with Mercury and Jupiter. These aspects indicate internal emotional turbulence and a buildup of tension likely associated with unresolved domestic issues.\n • The opposition of the Moon to Jupiter and the Mercury–Moon squares amplify a sense of exaggeration and internal conflict.

Rotated Chart Findings for Suzanne\n • When the chart is rotated so that Stefan’s seventh house corresponds to your Ascendant’s fourth house, that house falls in Gemini—which is ruled by Mercury. This designates Mercury as the significator for his wife, Suzanne, and her marital status.\n • In the natal chart, Mercury sits in Pisces (at 13°), and is involved in tense aspects (notably, a near square with the Moon and a square with Jupiter) that signal communication difficulties and internal conflict. These aspects forecast that Suzanne’s role in the relationship is becoming strained.\n\n2. Transits and Progressions Reflect on Marital Strain\n • The progressive data—particularly the series of near-exact Moon progressions on February 24, March 7, and March 13—indicate that the significator for Stefan (the Moon in Sagittarius in his 9th house) is being activated with increased urgency.\n • Concurrently, transiting Mercury, which channels communication, is making strong interactions with natal Mercury and with the Ascendant. These markers suggest that around March 13th, key communications (or internalized decisions) will surface.\n • The opposition of the Moon with Jupiter produces an element of exaggeration and intensity. In tandem with Mercury’s tension, this suggests that any message regarding marital decisions will come forth in a raw and unfiltered manner—one that may even be bluntly critical of the current state of the relationship.\n\n3. Implications on the Divorce Decision\n • The rotated chart and transit evidence imply that the internal decision regarding divorce is already in motion. The stress marked by Mercury’s strained aspects (as Suzanne’s significator) aligns with your other divinatory findings: that Stefan and Suzanne are moving toward a decision to file for divorce.\n • The activation of key progressions and transit aspects on March 13th indicates that this is the period when those internal resolutions are crystallizing. The atmosphere is charged with emotional tension and a need to communicate difficult truths—thus, it is likely that the decision (or its public reflection) will be conveyed around this time.\n • Later transit influences, such as those from Mercury and the supportive yet still tensioned influence of Venus, suggest that while the news may carry moments of personal regard, it will also be accompanied by unfiltered criticism and an admission of conflict.\n\nConclusion (strictly based on the chart’s data):\n– The rotated chart confirms that Suzanne’s role is signified by Mercury in Gemini, a key element currently under stress.\n– The transit and progression data—especially around March 13th—corroborate that internal marital decisions, including the choice to file for divorce, will be forged and communicated during that period.\n– Therefore, the chart does reflect that Stefan’s forthcoming communication (in its raw and conflicted tone) is likely to include, or be directly related to, the decision to initiate divorce proceedings. The eventual filing, as indicated by subsequent transit activations and gradual softening (supported by Venus) of the harsh tones, may then follow in April, in line with your other divinatory methods.\n\nThis analysis is strictly in line with the horary principles and the specific rotation key provided.","gen_started":"2025-02-21T13:33:13.096Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-21T13:33:36.156Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is the focused interpretation as it pertains to your query regarding Stefan’s marital situation, using the rotated horary chart and associated transit data:\n\n1. Rotated Chart Findings for Suzanne\n • When the chart is rotated so that Stefan’s seventh house corresponds to your Ascendant’s fourth house, that house falls in Gemini—which is ruled by Mercury. This designates Mercury as the significator for his wife, Suzanne, and her marital status.\n • In the natal chart, Mercury sits in Pisces (at 13°), and is involved in tense aspects (notably, a near square with the Moon and a square with Jupiter) that signal communication difficulties and internal conflict.
