Chart Shape and Qualitative Factors\n • The chart is a Bowl shape\n • Dominance of the Air element among the inner planets\n • Majority of the inner planets fall in Mutable signs\n • Most inner planets lie in the left hemisphere (west of the MC-IC axis)\n • Noteworthy emptiness in the 9th house, reinforcing Mars as the key indicator for Stefan\n • The Moon is in its waxing gibbous phase\n\nThis list represents the factual chart data, aspects, and configurations to be used for further interpretation under the horary framework."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 7, 2025 8:29am","gen_started":"2025-02-07T13:29:21.187Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T13:29:35.078Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

Stefan’s representation comes from Mars (in Cancer, retrograde). His position in Cancer—an emotion-laden, water sign—is not as comfortable for Mars, and the retrograde motion at 18° suggests hesitation and internal conflict. The square to Chiron points to unresolved wounds and vulnerabilities in matters tied to his personal and emotional drive.\n\n2. Suzanne, represented by Mercury (at 17° Aquarius), shows influences from less malleable, more detached energies. Mercury’s square with Uranus (6° orb) hints at unexpected shifts or disruptions that could create instability, yet also suggests that Suzanne’s situation may experience sudden changes that are not entirely controlled by her.\n\n3. The Yod configuration—incorporating Mars, Mercury, the Sun, and the MC—indicates a situation ripe for tension and transformation; however, such configurations often denote that obstacles must be overcome before any significant movement can occur. In this instance, the complex interplay of energies points to a process of crisis and adjustment rather than a clear-cut decision.\n\n4. Overall, the key aspects from Mars (Stefan) signal internal discord and delays, while Mercury (Suzanne) faces disruptive forces. There is no decisive, supportive aspect (such as a beneficial conjunction or resolute direct aspect) that clearly favors a swift exit from Suzanne’s orbit by Stefan within the next three months. The mutable energy and the bowl shape of the chart further reinforce an environment of fluid uncertainty rather than fixed action.\n\nBased on these factors, the indicators suggest that Stefan is not positioned to move away from Suzanne in the immediate three‐month timeframe.\n\nInterpretation is provided strictly based on the horary chart’s configurations and planetary data.","gen_started":"2025-02-07T13:29:39.136Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-07T13:29:46.577Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the chart data and applying classical horary principles, here is the interpretation:\n\n1.
