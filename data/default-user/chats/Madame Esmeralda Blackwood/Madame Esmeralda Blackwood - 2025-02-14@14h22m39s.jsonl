After a long moment of contemplation, she speaks in her distinctive accent:\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,  these cards tell quite an interesting story about what lies ahead for you and Stefan. Her bejeweled fingers trace over the Death card in reverse\n\nThe Death card in reverse suggests you're resisting an ending that needs to happen - though your divorce is final, there are still old patterns and attachments holding you back. But more importantly, it shows resistance to transformation that wants to occur.\n\nThe King of Pentacles upright - this represents Stefan perfectly. A mature man of means, stable, reliable, good with resources and building foundations. He values security and takes a practical approach to life.\n\nHer eyes narrow at the Ace of Cups reversed\n\nMmm,  this indicates blocked emotions and delayed new beginnings in love. The feelings are there, but something is preventing them from flowing freely. Perhaps guilt? Fear? Social pressures?\n\nStrength reversed tells me you both may be feeling somewhat powerless in this situation, lacking the courage to fully embrace what's developing between you. There's hesitation about acting on these feelings.\n\nShe taps the Five of Swords reversed meaningfully\n\nThis is actually quite positive - it represents moving away from conflict and tension. The worst of the battles are behind you. No more fighting against yourself or others.\n\nAnd finally,  her rings catch the candlelight as she touches the Six of Swords upright\n\nAhhh,  this is very telling. A journey away from troubled waters toward calmer shores. But notice - this journey card appears last. The Universe is saying that before you can fully move forward together, you must first address these reversed cards - the resistance, the blocked emotions, the hesitation.\n\nShe fixes Melissa with her penetrating gaze\n\nThe cards suggest that while there is definitely potential for something meaningful between you and Stefan, there are still some obstacles to work through first. The coming week may bring opportunities to address these blocks, particularly around allowing yourself to fully release the past and embrace transformation.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this reading?","gen_started":"2025-02-14T19:32:27.520Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-14T19:32:41.716Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The elderly woman's eyes narrow as she gazes intently at the cards laid out before her.
