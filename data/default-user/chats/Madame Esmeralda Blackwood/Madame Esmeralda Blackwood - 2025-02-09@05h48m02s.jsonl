Significators and House Representations\n • Stefan is represented by the Ascendant – Gemini at 6°39′. In this event chart his identity is indicated by the Ascendant (and its companion planet, Jupiter in Gemini in the 1st house).\n • Melissa is represented by the 9th house, which in this chart points to the “other” or “foreign” influence. With few direct planets in the 9th house, its ruler becomes key. The 9th house is ruled by Saturn (since Capricorn is its natural association), and here Saturn is taken as your significator. Saturn is placed at 18°21′ Pisces (found in the 11th house alongside Venus, Neptune, and the North Node).\n\n2. Key Planetary Placements\n • Stefan’s core identity (Ascendant) in Gemini suggests a communicative, flexible, and mentally agile approach. With Jupiter also in Gemini (1st house), there are hints of optimism and expansiveness in his self-expression.\n • Saturn (Melissa’s significator as the ruler of the 9th house) in Pisces underscores themes of sensitivity, boundaries dissolved by compassion and sometimes a blend of idealism with reality. Its placement in the 11th house adds an element of friendship, social networks, and group associations.\n\n3. Important Aspects Connecting Significators and Their Influences\n • Mars in Cancer (18°23′, retrograde, in the 2nd house) trine Saturn in Pisces (orb 0°):\n  – This very tight trine between Mars (the planet of drive, passion, and immediate energy) and Saturn (Melissa’s significator) points to an active, tangible connection. It suggests that Stefan’s actions or instinctive responses may have been harmoniously linked with the influence you represent.\n • Moon in Cancer (13°08′, in the 2nd house) trine Saturn (orb 5°):\n  – The Moon reflects emotional attunement. A trine from the Moon to Saturn indicates a supportive emotional resonance and a nurturing quality in his inner responses toward your energy.\n • Jupiter in Gemini (1st house) square Saturn (orb 7°):\n  – This square introduces tension between expansive self-expression (Jupiter with the Ascendant) and the serious, sometimes reserved energy of Saturn (Melissa’s representation). This aspect may denote inner conflict or the need to balance idealism with responsibility.\n • Additional aspects involving the Ascendant and shared energies:\n  – Mercury in Aquarius (20°52′) is conjunct the Sun in Aquarius (20°55′), emphasizing intellectual clarity; however, both are square Uranus in Taurus (orb 3°), indicating bursts of sudden, unexpected insights or disruptions.\n  – Mercury also forms a sextile with Chiron (1° orb), suggesting healing or recognition of past wounds in the surrounding conversation.\n  – Venus (in Aries at 3°31′) shows multiple supportive aspects (sextile Pluto, sextile the Ascendant, and sextile the Midheaven) that heighten matters of attraction and value in the scene. Although Venus does not directly represent either significator here, these aspects create an atmospheric support for interpersonal magnetism.\n • Uranus and Neptune in their supportive aspects (Uranus sextile Neptune at a 5° orb; Saturn sextile Uranus also at a 5° orb) contribute a background of innovative energy and idealistic, sometimes spiritual, overtones.\n\n4. Chart Patterns and Elemental Emphasis\n • The chart forms a Bowl shape with a dominant Air element (especially among the inner planets). This places emphasis on thought, communication, and intellectual processing – qualities you’d expect in an event where perception plays a key role.\n • The “Cradle” pattern (involving Pluto in Aquarius, the IC in Leo, the Ascendant in Gemini, Venus in Aries, and the MC in Aquarius) reinforces themes of transformation and interpersonal impact.\n • The internal distribution shows most inner planets occupying the top and left hemispheres, suggesting that the event is public (or interpersonal) and that Stefan’s personal expressions (via the Ascendant) are charged by external reflections (such as the influence of your Saturn).\n\n5. Summary of Relevant Data for the Query\n • Stefan (Ascendant in Gemini, with Jupiter’s influence) provides his point-of-view and initial impulse in the chart.\n • You (Melissa) are represented by the 9th house’s ruler, Saturn in Pisces, demonstrating qualities of sensitivity, depth, and a need for structure or boundaries in a context that may carry an idealistic, even spiritual, tone.\n • The Mars trine Saturn aspect (orb 0°) is the most critical link between his dynamic, action-oriented side and your grounded, serious energy, suggesting that his thoughts and feelings were activated in a supportive and possibly compelling way in your direction.\n • The Moon trine Saturn further supports a warm, if cautious, emotional bond.\n • The Jupiter square Saturn tension introduces an element of struggle between his open, expansive self-expression and the responsibility or reservation that you, as the 9th/foreign figure, may represent.\n • Background aspects involving Uranus and Neptune introduce sudden insights and a dose of idealism that could influence his perception.\n\nThis complete listing provides the required concrete data points—planets, aspects, house placements, and patterns—that will form the framework for interpreting Stefan’s immediate thoughts and feelings toward you during the event.","gen_started":"2025-02-09T10:50:33.830Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-09T10:51:01.167Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a step‐by‐step listing of the chart data most relevant for interpreting Stefan’s thoughts and feelings toward you (Melissa) at the event, using event (horary) chart principles:\n\n1.

I actually drew up the chart to try to get a feeling for if he will respond to me or not, meaning my message sent yesterday on February the 8th.\n\n I don't want to draw up another horrory chart right now because I made a promise that I wouldn't until February the 12th on the full moon.
