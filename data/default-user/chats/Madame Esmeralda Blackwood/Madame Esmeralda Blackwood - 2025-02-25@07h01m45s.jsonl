I mean, if that's the case, what am I supposed to believe in? The only thing that I've managed to get solid readings about is that his marriage will end in divorce and very soon - likely within the next two weeks they will decide to separate and file for divorce. All of those readings show the same outcome. However, I can't validate that concretely. I don't even know what's going on in his home life, to be honest, and I can't get that information anywhere either.
