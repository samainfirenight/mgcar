Our client, Melissa, has a very unique question, and she wants an exact, specific answer to it. So I believe I need some support to devise a proper question for the cards that will remove any ambiguity and give exact, concrete answers. I will explain the situation because I don't even have a clue at all how to get this answer.\n\nOn January the 8th, Melissa received a message from Stephan that was decidedly different than his typical communications in a positive way, at least as how she took it. However, since then she has not heard from him in two weeks. She's got chart data and tarot readings that tell her the potential outcome and what is likely occurring in his life. So that's not the angle she wants to take. What she wants to understand is the message from him on January the 8th: Was there any hidden meanings behind the actual surface level default meaning?  and also there was a specific phrase of, we will stay in contact. She would like to know if there was hidden meaning behind that phrase and what the hidden meanings were, if any.\n\n With all of that said, please can you help me with the correct questions to ask the cards?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
