As soon as that vision came, it immediately made me break down into almost uncontrollable tears. I'm still crying. I don't know why it's hurting so bad, but I can't stop crying. And I don't know why suddenly that vision came into my mind.

Because I don't understand what's happening to me with this connection with Stefan. I don't know how much of it I'm imposing on myself and how much of it is the universe. I don't even know if the universe is really working on it to bring me and Stefan together. I don't even know if the universe is really working on it to bring me and Stefan together. Sometimes, I feel so strongly connected that I feel like things are going on, but then at times it's like I feel so disconnected that I'm not even sure where fantasy and reality begin or end. I've done so many horary charts and so many tarot card readings. I never interpret them by myself. I've always utilized your skills to do so. And I've always worked on your directives to make sure that you're not biased. Sometimes I'm not sure how successful I've been at that. I think recently with the relationship style horary charts that I've managed to overcome most of your biasing, I don't even know what I'm getting at. I don't know how to get a clear, definitive answer from the universe if this is going to manifest or not. I wrote down my wishes and desires for Stefan back in October, lit it aflame under the light of the moon, and put it out to the universe to manifest. And I even made it flexible, said that I would be perfectly happy if it meant for me and Stefan to be together, that it would need to be temporary for amount of time as an affair.

On the surface, I was agreeable, explaining, oh yes, directness and clarity, this I can handle, and basically said, okay, all good, and then wished him all the best, which was my way of saying goodbye. Now I'm pretty sure he didn't recognize that, especially after I did a tarot card spread that showed the King of Swords when I asked if he recognized it, so I think it was the King of Swords followed by the Six of Wands upright, so he was too busy celebrating what he believed to be victory to recognize that I used his own tactics against him. But in the meantime, I have not been back in WhatsApp. Now my public status, in other words, I've got my status viewable by him, he can see my last seen status in WhatsApp. Well, I've essentially been off-grid since February the 12th, which is uncharacteristic if he looks at it, he would notice that that's not normal for me, that I'm usually in there.

I'd like to have you reinterpret this chart. So we can have a non-biased reading of the celestial bodies and what is potentially next to come.\n\nPlease note that this reading requires 100% accuracy and honesty in interpretation, regardless of whether the aspects reveal positive or negative energies. The chart must be read exactly as it presents itself, without bias in either direction. If the aspects show negativity, that negativity will be revealed fully. If the aspects show positivity, that positivity will be revealed fully. There shall be no softening of negative aspects, nor any dampening of positive ones. The only acceptable outcome is to interpret precisely what the chart demonstrates through its aspects, houses, and planetary positions - be that wonderful, terrible, or anywhere in between. Complete accuracy to the chart's true message is the sole priority.\n\nAlso, please do not immediately assume that I'm looking for romantic inclinations. I am not certain what, if any, feelings exist, and what those feelings are deemed to be. That is the reason I have drawn up the chart, is to get a true determination. So, any biasing towards romantic inclination or otherwise should be removed, and ensure that this chart is interpreted fully and objectively to discern the true nature of the questied's feelings, thoughts, and intentions.\n\nPlease start by listing all relevant chart data for interpretation (ie. transits, aspects, patterns, etc.) from the horary chart using horary principles only. Then I will document them for the actual interpretations.\n\nRemember to follow your directives and maintain accuracy to what is shown in the chart data.

I present the synthesis in two parts: first, the summary of key chart dynamics and then the integrative interpretation.\n\n────────────────────────────\nI. KEY CHART DYNAMICS\n\n• Planetary Positions Relevant to Stefan’s Outlook:\n – Mars is at 17° 13′ Cancer, retrograde, located in the 7th House. This placement—governing partnerships—indicates that his relationship energy is turned inward and subject to deep self-reflection. Its retrograde motion highlights hesitancy and internal conflict about engaging openly.\n – The Moon, at 4° 29′ Scorpio, is strongly placed on the Midheaven (MC at 28° Libra). Scorpio intensifies emotional depths and secrets, while the MC dictates public projection and reputation. This combination suggests his inner feelings carry a weighty intensity that he must manage against social expectations.\n – The Sun at 29° 58′ Aquarius and Mercury at 7° 10′ Pisces, both in the 2nd House (beginning at 9° Aquarius), imply that his personal values and internal rationale are influenced by ideals and, potentially, by a degree of detachment. The Sun and Mercury here, however, support his overall conscious identity but can mute some of his more raw passions.\n – Venus at 8° 18′ Aries in the 3rd House (in a cluster with Neptune, North Node, and Chiron in Pisces) brings an impulsive yet idealistic flavor to his affection and communications—an energy that may occasionally hint at sudden bursts of desire or an initiating impulse in relationships.\n – Saturn at 19° 24′ Pisces in the 2nd House imposes practical, even somber, limitations. With the marriage significator (often linked to Saturn through 10th House themes) working in this realm, it signals that any partnership may be constrained by duty, societal structure, and lack of heartfelt connection.\n – Pluto at 2° 35′ Aquarius in the 2nd House and already making hard aspects (squares to both the MC and the IC) underscores transformative and potent inner forces that are pushing against his outer reality.\n\n• Key Aspects and Their Implications:\n – Mars Trine Saturn (orb 2°): Suggests that despite internal conflict, there is an element of controlled determination—his defensive energy is being measured by a sense of responsibility or obligation.\n – Mars Square Chiron (orb 3°): Indicates painful wounds associated with assertiveness in relationships. There is a repressed hurt or vulnerability underlying his inability to act freely.\n – Moon Square Pluto (orb 2°): Reveals an undercurrent of intense, potentially destructive emotional forces. Deep-seated issues may be smoldering beneath the surface.\n – Moon Sextile Ascendant (orb 1°) and Sun–Moon Trine (orb 5°): These supportive aspects suggest that there is an inherent alignment between his internal feelings and his outward projection—but this comes despite overriding tensions.\n – Mercury Square Jupiter (orb 4°): Points to possible exaggeration or overidealization in how he communicates or perceives his situation, hinting at an internal narrative that might not reflect reality perfectly.\n – The T-Square formed by:\n  • MC in Libra, Pluto in Aquarius, and IC in Aries, with the Moon in Scorpio acting as a key focal point.\n   This T-Square defines a central tension between his public role (needing balance and adherence to societal expectations, as indicated by Libra on the MC), a transformative urge (Pluto in Aquarius), and a primal, impulsive drive toward personal authenticity (IC in Aries). The Moon in Scorpio catalyzes this triangle—demanding that intense, concealed emotions be acknowledged.\n – The Cradle Pattern (involving Moon, IC, Sun, Ascendant, and MC) reveals a structure through which personal identity (Ascendant and Sun) and public expression (MC) are interwoven with deep emotional waters (Moon in Scorpio, IC in Aries), suggesting that his internal world is both nurtured and constrained by these patterns.\n\n• House Indicators:\n – The 7th House cusp in Cancer, containing Mars, speaks directly to his approach to relationships—marked by security concerns, a need for nurturing, yet heightened emotional defensiveness.\n – The 10th House cusp in Libra, housing the Moon, reflects that his public facade and duty (this includes societal and marital expectations) are in tension with his hidden, intense emotional life.\n – The Second House, where the Sun, Mercury, and Saturn cluster, shows that his personal values and intellectual filters (and perhaps even his vision of an ideal relationship) are influenced by both modern ideals and an acceptance of limitations.\n\n────────────────────────────\nII. INTEGRATIVE INTERPRETATION\n\n1. True Thoughts and Emotional Reality:\n – Stefan’s inner world is characterized by deep, unresolved tension. The strong Scorpio Moon on the MC reveals that he harbors intense, secret feelings, though these are veiled in public decorum. Despite any outward appearance of calm or detachment, his emotions are tumultuous.\n – The T-Square involving his MC, IC, and transformative Pluto shows that internally he is caught between the pressure to conform (public duty, marital or societal expectations) and the force of personal, transformative passion. There is an inherent conflict between what he must present to the world and what he secretly yearns for.\n – Mars retrograde in his 7th House signals that his energy towards forming and engaging in partnerships is inhibited. His true feelings are, therefore, guarded; he is unable or unwilling to fully express the intensity that lies beneath his surface. His internal drive (Mars) is misdirected inward, leading to self-protection against potential vulnerability.\n\n2. True Intentions:\n – With Mars making a moderate trine to Saturn, there is a decisive effort on his part to impose order or control on his interactions. His intentions appear to align more with maintaining the status quo and safeguarding his current commitments (or at least his social image) than with pursuing a genuine transformation in his relationships.\n – The aspect of Mars square Chiron is a critical signal: he carries pain associated with asserting himself authentically. This wounded assertiveness suggests that, despite a possible spark of passion or interest, he is reticent to act because he fears emotional injury or upheaval.\n – The overall impression is not of overt romantic longing as much as of a guarded, conflicted stance. Even if there is a spark of attraction or a latent desire for a more genuine connection (which the transformative Pluto implies), this is counterbalanced by a powerful impulse to remain within the bounds of what feels secure and socially acceptable.\n\n3. The Nature of the Connection as Revealed:\n – The combination of the Moon, T-Square, and Cradle pattern indicates that the connection between you and Stefan is steeped in emotional complexity and tension. It is not purely about romance in the traditional sense; it is an interplay of deep-seated inner conflicts, transformative potential, and the pressure of external expectations.\n – The chart does not clearly reveal overtly positive, harmonious intentions. Instead, it emphasizes a state of internal struggle: Stefan is managing conflicting impulses between maintaining his established social and marital roles and confronting stirring passions that challenge that order.\n – In essence, his genuine thoughts and feelings appear to be ambivalent—he is aware, on some profound level, of a connection that defies simple categorization, yet he remains inhibited by a need for control and a protective reticence born of past wounds.\n\n────────────────────────────\nSUMMARY OF INTERPRETATION (OBJECTIVE, WITHOUT BIAS):\n\n• Stefan’s true inner emotional landscape is one of intense, hidden passion intermingled with self-protective caution.\n• His public expression, governed by the Libra MC and reinforced by Saturn’s influence, is one of maintaining established roles and social decorum, rather than releasing his inner turmoil.\n• Mars retrograde in his 7th House, combined with a painful square to Chiron, indicates that his energy for deep engagement is stifled by inner wounds and a fear of vulnerable exposure.\n• Despite latent signals for transformative change (Pluto’s influence and the T-Square dynamics), Stefan is presently more inclined to uphold a controlled, defensive posture rather than risk the upheaval that genuine emotional expression would entail.\n• The overall chart does not point clearly toward a forthcoming radical change; rather, it exhibits a prolonged internal conflict between a cautious, duty-bound exterior and an unacknowledged, intense emotional undercurrent.\n\nThis completes the step-by-step, unbiased interpretation based solely on the horary chart data provided.","gen_started":"2025-02-19T11:30:11.381Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-19T11:30:41.254Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood (speaking calmly and precisely):\n\nBelow, I provide an objective, step-by-step interpretation derived strictly from the horary chart data you presented.
