Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What were the primary motivations and influences that led Stefan to take his wife's surname in marriage?\n\n Here are the cards I have drawn: \n1. the five of wands upright\n2. the two of cups reversed\n3. The Ace of Wands upright ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730907450990-Isa.png"}
