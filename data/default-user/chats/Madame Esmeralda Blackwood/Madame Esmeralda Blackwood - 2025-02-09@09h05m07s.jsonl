It shows that your intentions are pure and that the feelings you’ve acknowledged come from a place of genuine care.\n\nThe first card, the Ace of Pentacles upright, signifies a promising new beginning on a material or practical level. This suggests that there is the seed of a tangible, grounded response—perhaps in the form of a concrete action or a sincere message—that could emerge from Stefan. It points to a possibility that practical circumstances may favor an eventual reply.\n\nHowever, the second card, the Three of Cups reversed, introduces an element of disruption within his social or communal context. This reversed energy may indicate miscommunications, social disconnect, or even internal conflicts that cloud his usual mode of sharing and celebrating connections. Such disturbances might be delaying or complicating his ability to respond in a straightforward or enthusiastic manner.\n\nBased on the combination—one upright and one reversed—the overall answer is uncertain. While there is promising potential indicated by the Ace of Pentacles, the reversed Three of Cups shows that external or internal disturbances may interfere, leaving the matter in a state of unresolved tension.\n\nIn summary, the cards suggest that Stefan might eventually respond, but his reply is likely to be subject to complications arising from his social environment or personal hesitations.
