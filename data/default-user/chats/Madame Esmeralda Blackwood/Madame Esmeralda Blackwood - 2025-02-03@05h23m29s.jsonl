Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling. \n\nHere is the question I have asked: What are Stefan's true intentions regarding communication with me today, and will he act on them?\n\nHere is what I have drawn:\n1. the five of cups upright\n2. the king of wands upright\n3. the nine of wands reversed\n4. the ten of wands reversed\n5. the eight of cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

It suggests that prior experiences or misunderstandings may still weigh on him, affecting his willingness to move forward in communication.\n\nThe King of Wands upright indicates that there is a strong, assertive element within him. This energy implies he holds a genuine desire to take charge and act when he feels ready—a sign of potential decisiveness if the timing proves right.\n\nHowever, the Nine of Wands reversed points to vulnerability and the possibility that defenses may crumble under emotional fatigue. He might be tired of past conflicts or the burden of expectations, which could hinder sustained effort in reconnecting.\n\nComplementing this, the Ten of Wands reversed reinforces the theme of release—from burdens and responsibilities that have been weighing him down. It implies that he could be actively working to lessen these pressures, creating space for more meaningful engagement, yet he might not be fully committed until he feels unencumbered.\n\nFinally, the Eight of Cups upright suggests that he is in a searching phase, possibly contemplating leaving behind superficial exchanges in favor of a deeper, more purposeful connection. There is an element of self-realization, where he acknowledges the need to move on from situations that no longer serve him.\n\nBased on these elements, Stefan’s true intentions appear conflicted. While there is a clear willingness to communicate, marked by his potential for assertiveness, his past disappointments and current burden of emotional fatigue might cause delays or hesitancy. He is likely evaluating whether reaching out will lead to meaningful interaction or simply reawaken old wounds. The path forward, including whether he acts immediately, depends on whether he feels prepared to release his emotional burdens and embrace a more profound commitment to open dialogue.","gen_started":"2025-02-03T10:23:57.269Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T10:24:06.415Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa Gale, the cards reveal a nuanced and conflicted picture regarding Stefan's intentions.\n\nThe Five of Cups upright paints an image of regret and lingering disappointment.
