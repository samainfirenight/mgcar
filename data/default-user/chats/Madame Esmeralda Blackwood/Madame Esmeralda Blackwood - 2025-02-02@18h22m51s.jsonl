There are several methods to narrow down the timing:\n\n1. Moon’s Movement and Aspects:\n • The Moon moves roughly 12–15° per day, meaning approximately 0.5–0.6° per hour. In your chart, the Moon in Aries forms aspects that confirm the imminent action.\n • We look for the Moon forming exact or critical aspects (conjunctions, squares, sextiles) to Mercury—the planet representing communication. For instance, if the Moon is currently about 2–3° away from an exact aspect with Mercury, you can estimate the time required for the Moon to “catch up” based on its hourly motion.\n • In your chart, the Moon’s sextile aspect to Jupiter (an indicator of fortuitous timing and optimism) and its position as a waxing crescent suggest that in roughly 24 to 48 hours it could form the exact aspect with Mercury or another relevant planet, thereby triggering the communication.\n\n2. Horary House Considerations:\n • With your Ascendant representing you and the 6th house representing Stefan (via the cross-reference), the timing can also be inferred when there is activation (through transits or progressions) of these house cusps. For example, if transiting planets (or the Moon’s progression) touch the cusp of the 6th house or form an exact aspect with Venus or Mercury positioned there, it intensifies the event.\n • The association of the Moon with the dynamics between these houses further narrows down the window—if the Moon is transitively moving toward a critical degree on the 6th cusp, then his communication is hastening.\n\n3. Planetary Hours and the Ruling Moment:\n • Some horary practitioners examine the planetary hour at the moment of the query along with the Moon’s progress, then calculate how many hours are needed for the Moon to reach the triggering aspect. For example, if at the time of the question your ruling hour is that of a fast-moving planet (such as Mercury) or if the Moon is advancing quickly toward a key degree, you can derive a relatively precise window.\n • In your case, by comparing the Moon’s current degree to the exact aspect with Mercury (or sometimes another significant planet tied to communication), then dividing the degree separation by the Moon’s hourly motion rate, you obtain an estimated interval in hours or days.\n\nTo summarize the calculation: Identify the arc the Moon must cover to complete the aspect with Mercury, note that the Moon moves about 0.5° per hour, and then estimate the time from now until the aspect is exact. Here, that protocol points to his message occurring within one to two days, aligning well with the overall chart indications of “soon” or “within days.”\n\nThis is how horary astrologers combine the Moon's positional progress, its aspects, and the timing of planetary hours to arrive at a more precise prediction regarding the moment of communication.","gen_started":"2025-02-02T23:51:52.334Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-02T23:53:23.172Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["In horary astrology, the Moon is a key indicator when timing an event—here, the initiation of communication.

When you ask precisely, the cosmic conditions will either confirm a rapid approach or suggest a delay. However, bear in mind that even with precise inquiry, short-term horary readings carry an inherent momentary snapshot—thus, while extremely focused, they reflect the immediate celestial alignment rather than committing the future absolutely.\n\nIn brief, by asking specifically about the next 24 hours, you harness the nuances of the current cosmic state, and the chart will provide a clear answer as long as all the necessary timing indicators are active."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"February 2, 2025 7:09pm","gen_started":"2025-02-03T00:09:22.022Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T00:09:28.953Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}]}

Timing Indicator (The Moon)\n • The Moon is a waxing crescent positioned at 13°43′ in Aries. Its phase indicates a new-emerging situation.\n • The Moon’s current position, along with its motion (approximately 0.5° per hour), implies that in 24 hours it will travel roughly 12° along the zodiac. This movement is crucial for triggering aspects that prompt action.\n • Notably, the Moon forms a sextile to Mercury (orb 4°). In horary practice, this supportive aspect is regarded as a direct indicator that the moment of communication is approaching. When the Moon reaches an exact aspect (by covering the short difference in degrees), it activates the event.\n\n2. Communication Indicator (Mercury)\n • Mercury, positioned at 9°44′ Aquarius in the 6th house, serves as the planet of correspondence. Its conjunction with the Sun and Pluto intensifies its communicative function by adding depth and urgency.\n • The direct, trine aspect between Mercury and Jupiter (orb 2°) further boosts the message’s clarity and underscores a positive, albeit transformative, communication.\n\n3. Stefan’s Representation\n • Following your earlier indication that Stefan is represented by his association with the 9th house, note that the 9th house cusp begins at 20° Aries and contains Uranus in the present chart.\n • Uranus in the 9th can signal unexpected or unconventional communication. With the Moon in Aries moving toward that cusp (given that the Moon in Aries in this chart is situated in a part of the zodiac preceding the 9th house), there is a suggestion that the final trigger could come as the Moon nears the cusp, emphasizing a rapid unfolding of events.\n\n4. Additional Aspects and Patterns\n • A T‑Square is present connecting the MC (24° Taurus), Ascendant (0° Virgo), and IC (24° Scorpio) with Uranus as one of the activators. This formation shows tension in balancing personal and external obligations, potentially causing a brief hesitation but not a full block in communication.\n • The Yod formed by the Ascendant (0° Virgo), North Node (29°44′ Pisces), and the combination of Pluto and Venus indicates an underlying destiny toward transformation. In practical terms, it implies that once the necessary trigger is met, any internal conflict or delay will dissolve quickly.\n\n5. Final Evaluation\n Based on the Moon’s prompt progress toward an activating aspect with Mercury, combined with supportive trine aspects and the near presence of Stefan’s representative factor (Uranus in the 9th), the chart indicates a strong likelihood of Stefan initiating communication within the next 24 hours.\n Minor tensions noted in the T‑Square suggest that internal or external factors may slightly delay the message, but they do not appear capable of preventing it.\n\nBased on the Moon’s position and movement, the direct supportive aspect to Mercury, and the overall configuration relating to Stefan’s indicator, the indication is that the message is set to be triggered within the next 24 hours.","gen_started":"2025-02-03T00:15:29.427Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T00:19:31.841Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the data in your horary chart, I will now analyze whether Stefan will communicate with you within the next 24 hours by employing traditional horary methods.\n\n1.
