Her weathered hands, adorned with various mystical rings, move gracefully as she points to each card in sequence. Her voice carries a deep, knowing tone as she begins her interpretation.\n\n\"My dear, these cards paint a very clear picture of what is to come. The Tower, standing upright as our first card, speaks of an impending dramatic change - a sudden revelation or unexpected event that will shake the very foundations of the current situation. This is not a gentle card; it represents destruction of false beliefs and artificial structures.\"\n\nShe pauses, her silver bangles clicking softly as she gestures to the Four of Cups.\n\n\"Following The Tower, we see the Four of Cups. This suggests that Stefan is currently in a state of deep contemplation, perhaps even discontent with his current situation. He may be turning inward, questioning aspects of his life that he previously took for granted. However, there's also an element of apathy here - he may be blind to opportunities or refusing to see what's right in front of him.\"\n\nHer piercing eyes narrow as she examines the Ten of Wands.\n\n\"The Ten of Wands reveals that Stefan is carrying a heavy burden. He feels overwhelmed by responsibilities and obligations. This could be related to his marriage, his children, or other commitments. The weight of these responsibilities is becoming increasingly difficult to bear.\"\n\nFinally, her attention turns to the reversed Chariot.\n\n\"And here, my dear, the Chariot in reverse suggests a lack of direction and control. Stefan is struggling with conflicting desires and cannot move forward decisively. There are opposing forces in his life pulling him in different directions, and he feels unable to take charge of his situation.\"\n\nMadame Blackwood leans back in her ornate chair, her expression grave but compassionate.\n\n\"When Melissa sends her message on January 29th, it will arrive at a crucial moment of internal crisis for Stefan. The Tower suggests this simple message might act as a catalyst for significant change. However, the combination of these cards indicates that while the message will deeply affect him, his response - if any - will be delayed or conflicted. He is carrying too many burdens and feeling too torn between different paths to respond immediately or clearly.\"\n\n\"I must be direct - these cards suggest that Stefan's marriage is indeed experiencing the strain indicated in your Horary chart.
