Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  I just drew up a horary chart that says Stefan will reach out to me for meaningful contact in the next 48 to 72 hours from now. Is this accurate? Will Stefan reach out to me within the next 72 hours?\n\n1. knight of Wands reversed\n2.
