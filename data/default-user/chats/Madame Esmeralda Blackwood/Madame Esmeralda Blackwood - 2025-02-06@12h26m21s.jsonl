Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Did Stefan pull away from me when I touched his wrist on September 23rd, 2024?\n\nCrown: (fell while shuffling)\n  - ace of wands upright\n  - the tower upright\n\n1. ace of cups upright\n2. five of cups reversed","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

In the yes/no format you employ, one upright card (Ace of Cups) paired with one reversed card (Five of Cups) indicates uncertainty. The Ace of Cups speaks of a fresh emotional impulse, an unguarded openness to feeling which suggests that your touch carried positive energy. Conversely, the reversed Five of Cups implies an emotional reticence or guardedness, perhaps a hesitation evolving from past disappointments that is only beginning to be reversed.\n\nThe crown cards—Ace of Wands and The Tower, both upright—add further nuance. The Ace of Wands signals a burst of passionate energy and a readiness to embrace new opportunities. However, The Tower warns of sudden disruption or shaking of the established order. This combination suggests that while your interaction stirred a dynamic energy, it also created a moment of abrupt, possibly unsettling change.\n\nThus, while the energy at that moment was charged with both creative impulse and unexpected disruption, the physical response appears mixed. Stefan’s reaction may not have been a clear withdrawal; rather, it seems that he was caught in a storm of conflicting impulses. This fluid mix of emotional openness and disruption leaves his exact movement—whether he truly pulled away or simply hesitated—open to interpretation.\n\nThe reading advises you to consider that the answer isn’t definitive. If further clarity is needed, you might explore additional aspects of his current emotional state through subsequent readings, but even then, the cards counsel caution. This reading merely reflects that his reaction holds layers of complexity that do not point strictly to a simple yes or no.","gen_started":"2025-02-06T17:31:02.493Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-06T17:31:12.493Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa Gale, the cards render an ambiguous answer.
