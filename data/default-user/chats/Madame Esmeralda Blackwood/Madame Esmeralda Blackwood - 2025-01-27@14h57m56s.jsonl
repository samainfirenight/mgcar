I want to know if there's any kind of hidden meaning to it, because the way that it looks, I'm almost convinced that all of the tarot card readings, all of the charts that I've read, that everything is wrong.\n\nSo I want to draw up a horary chart to tell me exactly what's going on with this message that he just sent me, but I don't know how to ask the question. Can you help me to devise a proper question for my horary chart so I will get a concrete answer with no ambiguity?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
