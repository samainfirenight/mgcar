This indicates approximately 4-5 weeks from today's date.\"\n\nShe taps the chart meaningfully, \"The presence of multiple malefics in angular houses suggests this won't be an entirely smooth process, but the Grand Trine involving your co-significator promises an eventual resolution in your favor.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"January 23, 2025 6:18pm","gen_started":"2025-01-23T23:18:30.513Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-23T23:18:38.078Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
