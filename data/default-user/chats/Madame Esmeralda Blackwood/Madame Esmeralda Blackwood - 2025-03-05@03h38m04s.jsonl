Madame Esmeralda Blackwood sits at a circular table draped in deep purple velvet, her silver hair cascading over her shoulders, adorned with intricate beaded ornaments that catch the flickering candlelight. Her piercing eyes study you intently as you explain your question and the cards you've drawn.\n\n\"Ah, my dear Melissa,\" she says in a rich, melodious voice with a hint of an unplaceable accent. \"You've come with an important question about the urgency you feel stirring within you. Let us examine what the cards have revealed.\"\n\nShe gestures to an imaginary spread before her, visualizing the cards you've described.\n\n\"The Hermit as your first card,  most interesting. This is a card of introspection, of inner wisdom and spiritual enlightenment. Upright, it suggests that this sense of urgency you feel is coming from a deep place within you—your higher self, your soul's wisdom. It is not an external pressure, but rather an internal calling.\"\n\nHer bejeweled fingers trace the air as if following the outline of the card.\n\n\"The Hermit carries a lantern, illuminating the path ahead. This urgency is like that lantern—it is guiding you toward something important, something that requires your attention and wisdom.\"\n\nShe moves her hand to indicate the second card position.\n\n\"The Two of Swords reversed tells me that this urgency stems from a decision you've been avoiding or delaying. In its reversed position, it speaks of confusion being lifted, of mental blocks dissolving. The blindfold is coming off, my dear. You've been at an impasse, perhaps trying to maintain a delicate balance or peace by not choosing a direction. But now, the universe is pushing you to make that choice.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow slightly as she contemplates the third card.\n\n\"The King of Wands upright—a powerful presence indeed. This is a figure of vision, leadership, and bold action. He represents the creative force that is building within you, demanding expression. This king doesn't hesitate; he acts with confidence and charisma. His appearance suggests that part of this urgency is your own creative or passionate energy that has been contained for too long and now seeks release.\"\n\nShe nods slowly, her numerous necklaces and amulets clinking softly as she shifts to consider the final card.\n\n\"And the Two of Wands upright completes this reading with perfect clarity. This card speaks of planning, making decisions about your future path, and considering your options for expansion. It often appears when one is standing at the threshold of greater possibilities, holding the world in their hands.\"\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans back slightly, her gaze intensifying as she synthesizes the meaning of all four cards together.\n\n\"The message here is remarkably clear, Melissa. The urgency you feel is the culmination of a spiritual awakening (The Hermit) that is pushing you to break through indecision (Two of Swords reversed) so that you can step into your power as a leader or creator (King of Wands) and begin planning the next significant chapter of your life's journey (Two of Wands).\"\n\nShe leans forward, her voice becoming more intimate.\n\n\"This is not an urgency born of external pressure or anxiety. It is the voice of your authentic self, your higher wisdom, telling you that the time for contemplation is ending and the time for decision and action is now. You have been in a period of gestation, of internal growth and preparation. Now, something within you is ready to be born, to be manifested in the world.\"\n\nHer ringed fingers tap thoughtfully on the table.\n\n\"The cards are telling you to trust this urgency. It is not random or meaningless—it is purposeful, guiding you toward a path of greater fulfillment and self-expression. The King of Wands particularly suggests that you have untapped leadership abilities or creative talents that are seeking expression.\"\n\nShe pauses, studying your face.\n\n\"Is there a specific project, decision, or life direction that has been calling to you, my dear?
