And he knew since I was going to be on a flight that I would have time to watch a movie. So he gave me a movie suggestion, and he was very, very insistent that I watch it. Although I at first was dismissive of it, he kept insisting I watch this movie called Love Actually. And when I finally agreed and said I'll check on Amazon Prime, he got very excited. His voice raised at least a couple of octaves, and he said, you have Amazon Prime? Yes, yes, it's on Amazon Prime. So you will watch it? And then I said, yeah, I'll download it and I'll watch it. And then he calmed down, and that's when his voice lowered, just as you described. And he said, I'd like to have a flight like that on Christmas.  And I asked what he meant, and he said, yeah, I would like to have a flight like that on Christmas.
