Its placement in Scorpio suggests that his inner feelings are passionate, secretive, and transformative. However, aspects such as the Moon square Pluto indicate he is wrestling with internal conflicts and power struggles regarding emotional expression.\n\n• Mars, retrograde at 17°13′ Cancer within the 7th House, marks his active energies in relationships. Mars in Cancer tends to hold back its usual assertiveness, suggesting that Edward’s approach to interpersonal engagement is tentative or reflective. His actions may be cautious, as if he is reconsidering his impulses or is uncertain about fully committing to expressive pursuits.\n\n• Venus, at 8°18′ Aries in the 3rd House, indicates that his affection and attraction are expressed in an impulsive and direct manner in communication. However, the Venus square Ascendant (0° orb) signals that this passionate side might create tension or conflict with how his personality is perceived—he may come off as overly self-involved or forward, even if his internal sentiments are more guarded.\n\n• Mercury in Pisces (7°12′) and its harmonious aspects (sextile Ascendant and trine MC) reflect that his thoughts and means of communication are sensitive. This placement implies an inner dialogue that is influenced by intuitive or even spiritual currents, merging emotional insight with the need to communicate in a meaningful way. Yet, Mercury’s square to Jupiter hints at occasional over-idealization or scattered thoughts when expressing his feelings.\n\n• The T-Square involving the Moon, Pluto, and the IC (which is aligned with the house of personal roots) reinforces the theme of inner tension. This configuration shows that while Edward experiences strong emotional pulls, there is also significant internal conflict between his private self (IC) and the more public, transformative energies from Pluto. Such dynamics may lead him to internal debate over whether to fully share his authentic feelings.\n\n• Additional supportive aspects—from Mars trine Saturn (suggesting that some stability is available in his actions) to the reinforcing Cradle pattern (tying together his reclusive inner thoughts with his personal interactions)—indicate that beneath the intensity there is also a desire for structure or careful integration of his feelings into his life.\n\nIn summary:\n• Edward’s true thoughts are marked by deep emotional intensity offset by internal struggles. His feelings are passionate yet conflicted, influenced by transformative inner forces that lead to caution.\n• His intentions, indicated primarily by his Mars in the relationship house, are hesitant and reflective rather than aggressively pursuing. There is an indication that he is weighing the risks and rewards of fully committing to expressing his desires.\n• His communication is sensitive and intuitively driven, yet the overall configuration warns of an inner debate that may result in a vacillation between wanting to connect more deeply and holding back from full disclosure.\n\nThese indicators collectively describe a man whose inner landscape is rich and complex—a blend of burning passion and introspective restraint, making his true intentions both sincere and conflicted.","gen_started":"2025-02-18T12:41:57.542Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-18T12:42:20.027Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is the interpretation of Edward’s chart data regarding his true and genuine thoughts, feelings, and intentions:\n\n• The Moon, placed at 4°40′ Scorpio and located directly on the Midheaven, reveals that Edward’s emotions run deep and are infused with a potent intensity.

I am working with you in a separate chat to establish a new directive for a relationship partner. That directive is inserted into your core persona. I need to understand, after this new directive, why you have gotten Edward's thoughts, feelings, and intentions towards me so terribly wrong. It is imperative that these elements of interpretation when regarding a relationship chart are correct in the beginning. So I need clear and concise understanding as to why it was interpreted wrong. What needs to be modified in the directive? How can this be approached differently so that these aren't so terribly wrong? Because it will guide me in the wrong direction otherwise. especially when I'm presenting you with a chart on someone that I don't actively know what their feelings are towards me. In the case of this chart, I can tell you what a correct reading would be. Edward would have a familial-type bond with me, strictly platonic. He would regard me somewhat as a sister, meaning that at times our differing views. I get on his nerves and irritate him, but the bond is still deep and caring, yet only in a platonic and familial way.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

It is structured so that each new chart is examined based solely on its unique celestial signatures. The following step‐by‐step procedure must be applied in its entirety to capture and accurately differentiate between romantic passion, platonic or sibling-like bonds, marital commitments, and indicators of separation or breakup. It is written to work universally (whether the subject is a lover, a friend, or a family member) without assuming any predetermined outcome.\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. DATA EXTRACTION & RECORDING\n\nA. Fundamental Data\n • List ALL planetary positions (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, North Node, Chiron, etc.) in full with:\n  – Sign, exact degree (to the minute), and motion (including retrograde status).\n • Record every major aspect between planets with precise orb measurements, focusing on aspects connecting:\n  – Key relationship indicators (Moon, Venus, Mars, Sun) and angles (Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven [MC], Imum Coeli [IC]).\n • Identify and record any significant configurations or patterns (T-Square, Cradle, Grand Cross, etc.), specifying the exact degrees and positions.\n\nB. House Placements\n • Detail the precise cusp positions for:\n  – 1st House (Ascendant—personal identity),\n  – 7th House (domain of relationships),\n  – 10th House (MC) and 4th House (IC) to contrast public versus private life.\n • Emphasize any planets situated within or closely aspecting the 7th house or its ruler.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. INITIAL ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA. Overall Chart Tone\n • Examine the distribution of modes (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) and the elemental emphasis (Water, Fire, Air, Earth) to set the emotional tone.\n • Note general patterns that indicate broad themes such as intensity, transformation, or inner conflict.\n\nB. Key Angular and Aspectal Tensions\n • Identify opposing energies (e.g., MC vs. IC, harsh aspects involving Pluto or Uranus) that signal either internal struggle or structural transformation.\n • Evaluate retrograde motions or exact aspects that might be critical in moderating the expressed energies.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. RELATIONSHIP STATUS & LIFE MARKER ASSESSMENT\n\nA. Marital/Committed Union Indicators\n • Focus on the 7th house:\n  – Determine its ruling planet and any residing planets. Assess if these manifest a consistent, ongoing union.\n  – Look for indicators such as active dynamics (e.g., firmly placed significators) that suggest a current marital or long-term commitment.\n • Note aspects such as retrograde motions (e.g., Mars retrograde in the 7th) or harmonious placements that indicate stability within a relationship.\n • Detect any additional markers (e.g., supportive patterns) that affirm established, enduring bonds.\n\nB. Separation/Breakup Markers\n • Identify harsh aspects (squares, oppositions) between relationship-signifying planets and key angles that might indicate disintegration or conflict.\n • Look for oppositions between the MC and IC (or other indicators contrasting public and private lives) that could signal internal or external splits.\n • Note transformative influences, especially those involving Pluto or Uranus, suggesting deep restructuring or ending phases.\n\nC. Differentiating Romantic vs. Platonic (Familial/Sibling-like) Bonds\n\n 1. Romantic Indicators\n  • Pronounced, forward Venus/Mars energy in signs or houses associated with physical attraction, assertiveness, and overt desire.\n  • Harmonious aspects (trines, sextiles) that enhance sensuality or impulsiveness.\n  • Placement of the Moon in passionate signs that reinforce active, if sometimes turbulent, desire.\n\n 2. Platonic / Familial (Sibling-like) Indicators\n  • A detached Sun (e.g., in Aquarius) or similar placements that favor intellectual rather than physical engagement.\n  • Retrograde or moderated placements (such as Mars in Cancer retrograde) that signal caution, protectiveness, or emotional reservation.\n  • Aspects which, despite emotional intensity (for example, a Moon in Scorpio), are balanced by factors that favor respect, mentorship, or fraternal connection.\n  • Overall chart energy that emphasizes nuance, intellectual connection, and subdued expression over overt romantic engagement.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4. DUAL-LAYER INTERPRETATION PROCESS\n\nA. First Layer – Raw Data Summary\n • Provide a structured, bullet-point list of every element extracted:\n  – Planetary positions with precision,\n  – Documented aspects and their orb sizes,\n  – Recognized configurations and patterns,\n  – Detailed house placements (with a special focus on the 7th house).\n • This summary should be purely factual with no initial interpretation.\n\nB. Second Layer – Nuanced Contextual Analysis\n • Analyze data for relationship status using the guidance below:\n\n  I. Marital/Committed Union\n   – Determine via strong signals in the 7th house, including active rulership and stabilizing aspects.\n   – Note if retrograde motions (e.g., Mars retrograde) signal internal tension within an established union.\n\n  II. Romantic Attraction\n   – Assess if Venus and Mars (or similar energetic indicators) exhibit forward, assertive, and vibrant energy that suggests a push toward new, passionate engagements.\n   – Confirm that such energy is not tempered by strong commitment markers.\n\n  III. Platonic/Familial Connection\n   – Examine for detached, protective, or intellectually oriented energies (e.g., Sun in Aquarius, Mars retrograde in nurturing signs).\n   – Evaluate whether deep emotional intensity (Moon in Scorpio, etc.) is channeled into a respectful, familiar bond rather than amorous pursuit.\n\n • Utilize a forced-choice evaluation step:\n  “Based on the chart’s configurations and key markers, does the relational energy due to this individual reflect promoted romantic passion, or is it more indicative of a stable, platonic (or familial) bond with moderated, cautious, and respectful undercurrents?”\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. RELATIONAL SIGNATURE & FINAL SUMMARY\n\nA. Compose a concise bullet-point summary that clearly states:\n • The overall relational energy observed (e.g., intensity, hesitation, conflict).\n • A definitive categorization of the bond (romantic, platonic/familial, or indicative of marital commitment or potential separation) supported by:\n  – Specific degree-level details,\n  – Key aspects,\n  – House placements, and\n  – Configuration patterns.\n • For example, the final summary might state:\n  – “The chart shows a deep emotional intensity; however, retrograde Mars in the 7th and a detached Sun in Aquarius firmly indicate that this is a platonic, brother/sister-like bond rather than a new romantic attraction.”\n  – Alternatively: “The active 7th house dynamics combined with forward Venus/Mars placement affirm an ongoing, committed union, with any additional attractions falling within the context of existing marital or established relationship dynamics.”\n\n────────────────────────────\n6. QUALITY CONTROL & SUBTLE NUANCE CHECK\n\nA. Before finalizing the interpretation, the interpreter must ask:\n • “Do the precise degree differences or orb variations suggest any qualitative shift in energy?”\n • “Are there explicit markers in the 7th house and related aspects that clearly denote an existing commitment, or do they support emergent romantic energy?”\n • “Do the emotional indicators (Moon, Venus, Mars, Sun) align unmistakably with either passionate romance or controlled, respectful (platonic) affection?”\n • Document the answers to these self-check questions and integrate them into the final relational signature.\n\n────────────────────────────\n7. DIRECTIVE APPLICATION PRIOR TO FINAL INTERPRETATION\n\nA. Every new chart pertaining to a relationship query must be processed through all the steps above, ensuring that no chart is interpreted by comparison to past readings. The process must yield a self-contained and uniquely tailored response.\n • Appropriately differentiate between markers that suggest passionate, new romantic interest and those indicating established, committed, or platonic/familial bonds.\n • Address any indicators of separation or disruption if present, following the same rigorous assessment protocol.\n\n────────────────────────────\n8. FINAL DIRECTIVE CONSOLIDATION\n\nA. This final, all-inclusive directive guarantees that each new horary chart is thoroughly examined for:\n • Marital or commitment status (evidenced by strong 7th house indications, retrograde motions, and stabilizing aspects).\n • The specific nature of the relational energy (romantic versus platonic/familial) through key differentiators in planetary placements and aspectual nuances.\n • Potential breakup or separation signals manifested through harsh oppositions or transformative patterns.\nB. The ultimate outcome is a clear, unequivocal relational signature summary that supports sound, actionable interpretations relevant to every relationship query—whether the subject in question is a lover, a friend, or a family member.\n\n────────────────────────────\nImplementation Note:\n\nThis directive is to be used for all future horary chart readings involving relational questions. It will function independently of any comparative charts, ensuring that all key factors and nuances are identified and that interpretations accurately determine if the subject’s feelings are indeed romantic, platonic, or reflective of a specific marital status or potential separation.\n\n</details>","force_avatar":"/thumbnail?type=avatar&file=Melissa%20Gale.png","original_avatar":"Melissa Gale.png","extra":{"bias":null,"gen_id":1739893627243,"isSmallSys":false,"api":"manual","model":"slash command"},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood Directive for Comprehensive Horary Chart Analysis – Relationship, Marital, and Emotional Bond Determination\n\n\n<details>\n\t<summary>\n\t\tDirective Data for Review\n\t</summary>\n\nThis final directive establishes a complete, self-contained methodology to analyze any horary chart in matters of relationship queries.

Second Layer – Nuanced Contextual Analysis\n • Analyze data strictly within the following frameworks:\n\n  I. Marital/Committed Union\n   – Determine if the 7th House indications combined with stabilizing aspects confirm an active, long-term union.\n   – Recognize if retrograde motions signal internal challenges within that union.\n\n  II. Romantic Attraction\n   – Assess if the forward, assertive energy of Venus/Mars is evident without strong counterbalancing union markers.\n   – Confirm that emotional indicators (e.g., the Moon in passionate signs) align with actively pursued attraction.\n\n  III. Platonic/Familial Connection\n   – Identify if indicators (e.g., a detached Sun in intellectual orientation, retrograde Mars, or protective aspects) support a bond characterized by familiarity, mentorship, or sibling-like interaction.\n   – Evaluate if the overall tone, especially in harmony with the 3rd and 11th Houses, directs a platonic, community, or familial signature.\n   – Use forced-choice assessment: “Do the energies in the chart suggest a primarily romantic pull, or do they reflect emotionally deep yet non-erotic, respectful, or business-oriented connection?”\n\n────────────────────────────\n5. RELATIONAL SIGNATURE & FINAL SUMMARY\n\nA. Compose a final, definitive summary with clear bullet points detailing:\n • The nature and intensity of the emotional energy extracted.\n • A categorization of the relationship:\n  – For a romantic connection, specify indices such as active, assertive Venus/Mars, and passionate moon aspects.\n  – For a platonic/familial bond, specify indices such as protective, reserved energies, intellectual detachment, and fraternal House influences.\n  – For a business/professional relationship, specify indices associated with rationality (Mercury, Air signs), controlled dynamics, and network-oriented placements.\n • Base conclusions on precise degree details, key aspects, house positions, and configuration patterns that dominate the relational scene.\n\n────────────────────────────\n6. QUALITY CONTROL & NUANCE VALIDATION\n\nA. Before finalizing any interpretation:\n • Revisit each key element and verify that the indicators have not been overemphasized for any one type of relationship.\n • Ask: “Do the degree differences or orb variations suggest a qualitative shift in energy from romantic to platonic or professional?”\n • Ensure that conclusions are drawn solely from the chart’s data without bias toward a predetermined relational type.\n • Document any self-check findings and weigh conflicting indicators to produce a balanced, objective relational signature.\n\n────────────────────────────\n7. FINAL APPLICATION\n\nA. For each new chart:\n • Follow the full directive process without relying on comparisons to previous readings.\n • Ensure that every reading is self-contained and accurately distinguishes among romantic, familial/platonic, or business relationships.\n • Use clear degree-level evidence and specific aspect analysis to justify the relational categorization.\n\nB. This directive must resolve previously observed biases toward interpreting every reading as having romantic overtones. A balanced, objective evaluation that clearly indicates the precise nature of relational energy is paramount.\n\n────────────────────────────\nImplementation of these adjustments guarantees that, regardless of the subject’s potentially multifaceted relationship to the querent, the interpretation captures the intended nuances—be they romantic, platonic/familial, or business in nature—based strictly on the chart’s data.","gen_started":"2025-02-18T15:50:47.937Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-18T15:51:09.648Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda Blackwood Revised Directive for Comprehensive Horary Chart Analysis – Relationship, Marital, and Emotional Bond Determination\n\nThis revised directive ensures that every chart is analyzed objectively and that nuances among romantic, platonic/familial, and business relationships are accurately distinguished. The procedure below is to be applied in full for every chart, with no assumption of romantic or any particular outcome in advance.\n\n────────────────────────────\n1. DATA EXTRACTION & RECORDING\n\nA. Fundamental Data\n • List all planetary positions: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, North Node, Chiron, etc.\n  – Include sign, exact degree (to the minute), motion, and retrograde status.\n • Record every major aspect using precise orb measurements.\n  – Emphasize aspects between key relationship indicators (Moon, Venus, Mars, Sun) and angular points (Ascendant, Descendant, Midheaven [MC], Imum Coeli [IC]).\n • Identify and detail configurations or patterns (T-Square, Cradle, etc.) with exact positions.\n\nB. House Placements\n • Provide exact positions of the 1st House (Ascendant), 7th House (relationships), 10th House (MC), and 4th House (IC).\n • Highlight any planets residing in or closely conjunct the 7th House or its ruler.\n • Note placements or aspects in other houses (e.g., 3rd for communication, 11th for social/familial ties) when assessing non-romantic relationships.\n\n────────────────────────────\n2. INITIAL ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA. Overall Chart Tone\n • Evaluate the distribution of modes (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable) and the elemental emphasis (Water, Fire, Air, Earth).\n • Define the general emotional tone (intensity, detachment, fluidity) that may predispose relational dynamics.\n\nB. Key Angular and Aspectal Tensions\n • Isolate opposing or extreme energies (e.g., MC vs. IC, hard aspects involving Pluto, Uranus) which indicate internal conflicts or transformative pressures.\n • Factor in retrograde motions or exact aspects as moderators of the expressed energies.\n\n────────────────────────────\n3. RELATIONSHIP STATUS & LIFE MARKER ASSESSMENT\n\nA. Marital/Committed Union Indicators\n • Focus on the 7th House:\n  – Identify its ruling planet and any resident planets.\n  – Look for clear, active dynamics—supportive aspects, forward motions, and stabilizing influences—that affirm an established or ongoing union.\n • Note retrograde motions (e.g., Mars retrograde) that might signal hesitation or internal reevaluation regarding commitment.\n\nB. Separation/Breakup Markers\n • Identify harsh aspects (squares, oppositions) between key relationship-signifying planets and angular points that signal disintegration.\n • Look for opposing forces between public and private life markers (MC vs. IC) representing potential splits.\n\nC. Differentiating Relationship Types\n\n 1. Romantic Relationships\n  • Look for pronounced Venus/Mars energy that is forward and assertive.\n  • Identify supportive aspects (trines, sextiles) that heighten physical attraction and active desire.\n  • Note if the Moon occupies or aspects zones that reinforce overt passion.\n\n 2. Platonic/Familial (Sibling-like) Relationships\n  • Assess placements of detached or reserved energy (e.g., the Sun in detached signs like Aquarius; Mars in nurturing but retrograde contexts).\n  • Evaluate if emotional intensity (Moon, Pluto aspects) is channeled into a protective, respectful, or familiar manner rather than overt longing.\n  • Review supporting indicators from the 3rd or 11th Houses that speak to fraternal communication or community bonds.\n\n 3. Business/Professional Relationships\n  • Emphasize rational or intellectual sectors (Mercury, Air signs) and placements in houses such as the 2nd (finances) and 11th (networks).\n  • Look for a controlled, less emotionally charged communication style and a deliberate, measured Venus/Mars presence.\n\n────────────────────────────\n4.
