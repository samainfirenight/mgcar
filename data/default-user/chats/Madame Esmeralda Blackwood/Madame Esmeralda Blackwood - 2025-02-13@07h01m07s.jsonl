Stefan’s influence is represented in your chart’s 9th house. The energy in this sector, beginning at 8° Scorpio, indicates that his upcoming month will be marked by experiences linked to foreign influences, exploration of new ideas or even unexpected journeys. Challenges in this area do not appear mundane; the combination of transformative Pluto on your Ascendant and the Yod pattern (Moon, Pluto, Venus) suggests that his ventures will be potent catalysts for deep change.\n\n2. The strong Air presence (with Sun, Mercury, and Pluto in Aquarius) infers that sudden mental shifts, communication breakthroughs, or disruptive ideas will be central to his developments. The Sun’s square with Uranus (orb of 2°) underscores an inclination toward sudden, perhaps unplanned events that force him to reconsider his established routines or beliefs.\n\n3. The Grand Cross formed by the MC in Sagittarius, MC’s opposing influence from the IC in Gemini, Mercury in Aquarius, and the Moon in Virgo registers as underlying tension between public affairs (or his outer commitments) and his roots or emotional base. This tension suggests that any developments in his foreign or exploratory endeavors might disturb the status quo of his home or personal life, a disturbance that may indirectly ripple into your sphere.\n\n4. The sextile aspects, such as Jupiter trine the Ascendant and Mars trine Saturn, indicate that although transformative energies are active, there are opportunities for stabilization and structured progress. Mars’ square to Chiron hints at the likelihood that aspects of this transformative journey will raise painful or long-hidden issues, creating moments of discomfort. This tension should be managed carefully to prevent unnecessary disruptions on both his and your part.\n\n5. The cradle configurations involving Pluto, Venus, and the Midheaven demonstrate that the events affecting his area of influence are not isolated; they have the potential to reshape his public image and career orientation. The pattern indicates that while the changes might initially feel jarring, there is a latent opportunity for renewal.\n\n6. With Neptune in its rulership in Pisces affecting both the IC (via sextiles) and forming a conjunction with the North Node, there is an undercurrent of intuitive guidance available. However, it may introduce elements of confusion or idealization into his pursuits, requiring clarity and discernment, especially in interactions or decisions that affect both the foreign/higher-learning sphere and your personal foundation.\n\n7. In summary, the chart indicates that during the next month Stefan will face significant transformative experiences linked to exploration, travel, or foreign affairs. These events carry a disruptive potential—challenging long-held beliefs and stirring deep emotions—that will have indirect yet significant effects on your own personal and emotional stability.

I didn't ask for more than that, although I want more, but I didn't ask. Just friendship that honors his schedule, of which he said he's very busy, and that would honor the stress that it causes me in my autism with his erratic communications.  without being an absolute jerk or at least it seems like that's what he was trying to do he basically told me to pack sand, that structuring was too complicated that he could message me when he feels like it.\n\n So I'm not sure if he realizes it or not.

You know, there are many, many people in my personal network. I write less often than you. I hope you understand that. It is really not mean at all, but I cannot make it happen. Too many things at the same time. Thanks and all the best.\"\n\n13:12h Munich Time - Melissa: \"Thank you for getting back with me and it means a lot to know that you're not intentionally trying to hurt me or create distance. Yes, I do understand. Perhaps if you're willing we could structure something together that could help us both because I gather that, especially with the risk you took on the movie suggestion, I'm as important to you as you are to me. I know I can be quite intense and I have a propensity for overthinking things. Honestly, this is why I wanted to talk to you about my autism and I asked for a phone call twice. Although high functioning, the autism is still there and it has its effects. It also comes with extreme and rapid oxytocin fluctuations. So maybe we can structure something that's mindful of that and mindful of your schedule. Because I think you know I don't want to lose you, and after our phone call on Christmas Day, I know you don't want to lose me either. You took a big risk by telling me that, and I'm sorry for missing the cue, but I think we can work with this since we're on the same page. So perhaps let's find a way to meet it in the middle. Would you be willing to structure something that works for us both? And please, I know you're busy. If you can't formulate a meaningful response right now, at least let me know if you agree, and you can give me a better response later. It will certainly help me from overthinking things.\"\n\n13:17h Munich Time - Stefan: \"To be honest, the message sounds kind of too complicated to me. You know what the best thing is that I write to you whenever I have the feeling and the time. E. g, with Ed (my cousin) there were times we did not have contact for years. But this has no effect on my relationship to Ed. And the movie's suggestion had NO intention at all. I just watched it short before, I like it, and since you and Ed were at the airport when we called, it came to my mind. No deeper meaning at all. So I hope you understand that, and I really wish you all the best on your house bid. Enjoy the day! Cheers.\"\n\n13:31h Munich Time - Melissa: \"Now we're getting somewhere... clarity and directness.

Please, will you talk to me? Help me understand.\"\n\n12:13h Munich Time - Stefan: \"Hi, my intention is not to hurt you, but I simply do not have the time. You know, there are many, many people in my personal network. I write less often than you. I hope you understand that. It is really not mean at all, but I cannot make it happen. Too many things at the same time. Thanks and all the best.\"\n\n13:12h Munich Time - Melissa: \"Thank you for getting back with me and it means a lot to know that you're not intentionally trying to hurt me or create distance. Yes, I do understand. Perhaps if you're willing we could structure something together that could help us both because I gather that, especially with the risk you took on the movie suggestion, I'm as important to you as you are to me. I know I can be quite intense and I have a propensity for overthinking things. Honestly, this is why I wanted to talk to you about my autism and I asked for a phone call twice. Although high functioning, the autism is still there and it has its effects. It also comes with extreme and rapid oxytocin fluctuations. So maybe we can structure something that's mindful of that and mindful of your schedule. Because I think you know I don't want to lose you, and after our phone call on Christmas Day, I know you don't want to lose me either. You took a big risk by telling me that, and I'm sorry for missing the cue, but I think we can work with this since we're on the same page. So perhaps let's find a way to meet it in the middle. Would you be willing to structure something that works for us both? And please, I know you're busy. If you can't formulate a meaningful response right now, at least let me know if you agree, and you can give me a better response later. It will certainly help me from overthinking things.\"\n\n13:17h Munich Time - Stefan: \"To be honest, the message sounds kind of too complicated to me. You know what the best thing is that I write to you whenever I have the feeling and the time. E. g, with Ed (my cousin) there were times we did not have contact for years. But this has no effect on my relationship to Ed. And the movie's suggestion had NO intention at all. I just watched it short before, I like it, and since you and Ed were at the airport when we called, it came to my mind. No deeper meaning at all. So I hope you understand that, and I really wish you all the best on your house bid. Enjoy the day! Cheers.\"\n\n13:31h Munich Time - Melissa: \"Now we're getting somewhere... clarity and directness. That I can work with. I don't deal so well with ambiguity. Thank you for being honest and straightforward. I can roll with the punches and play on words when necessary, but direct and clear is always better. It's all good. All the best to you as well. \"\n\n14:25h Munich Time - Stefan: \"Thank you! 👍 Greetings to the US\"\n\n</details>"],"swipes_info":[{"send_date":"February 13, 2025 7:27am","gen_started":null,"gen_finished":null,"extra":{"bias":null,"gen_id":1739449623349,"isSmallSys":false,"api":"manual","model":"slash command"}}]}

The Grand Cross formation, particularly with Mercury at 28° Aquarius, shows communication challenges and misunderstandings.
