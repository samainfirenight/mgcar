You see, I have horary charts, natal charts, transits, composites, everything that shows his marriage is due to be legally dissolved by the end of this year. They also show that the discord is happening right now. with legal proceedings to be filed somewhere mid to end of March of this year.\n\n However, since he's not communicating with me, I have no idea to know for sure if it's due to the discord or if it's due to just him being busy.  I do have a chart that specifically tells me it's because of discord, but I can't validate it. It still leads me to run on blind faith.\n\n Is there any type of question i could ask for horary, or something that we can utilize that will give me solid proof without having to ask him or ask anyone else about him? and I'll add going to public records is not an option and I've already tried extensively in social media and turned up nothing.
