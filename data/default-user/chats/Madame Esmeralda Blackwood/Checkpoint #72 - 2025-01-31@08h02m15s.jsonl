Significators by House:\n   • 1st House (Querent): 24° Leo\n     – Ruler (traditional): The Sun (located in 10°19′ Aquarius, 6th house)\n   • 7th House (Other Person): 24° Aquarius\n     – Ruler (traditional): Saturn (located in 17°12′ Pisces, 8th house)\n       (Modern co-ruler: Uranus, located in 23°15′ Taurus (r), 10th house)\n   • 3rd House (Communications): 13° Libra\n     – Ruler (traditional): Venus (located in 25°49′ Pisces, 8th house)\n   • Mercury (General Communication Significator): 3°3′ Aquarius, 6th house\n\n2. Notable Houses Containing Relevant Planets:\n   • 6th House: Sun (10°19′ Aquarius), Moon (16°25′ Aquarius), Mercury (3°3′ Aquarius), Pluto (1°59′ Aquarius)\n   • 8th House: Venus (25°49′ Pisces), Saturn (17°12′ Pisces), Neptune (27°54′ Pisces), North Node (29°57′ Pisces)\n   • 10th House: Jupiter (11°19′ Gemini, retrograde), Uranus (23°15′ Taurus, retrograde)\n   • 11th House: Mars (21°4′ Cancer, retrograde)\n\n3. Essential Planets for Timing and Communication:\n   • Mercury: 3°3′ Aquarius (communication, messages)\n   • Moon: 16°25′ Aquarius (co-significator of the querent, often used for timing in horary)\n   • Ruler of the 3rd: Venus (25°49′ Pisces) for communication matters\n   • Ruler of the 7th: Saturn (17°12′ Pisces) to signify Stefan\n   • Ruler of the 1st: Sun (10°19′ Aquarius) to signify the querent\n\n4. Key Aspects Involving Communication Planets (Mercury, Venus, Moon):\n   • Mercury Conjunction Pluto (orb 2°) in Aquarius (6th house)\n   • Mercury Sextile North Node (orb 4°) in Pisces (8th house)\n   • Mercury Sextile Neptune (orb 6°) in Pisces (8th house)\n   • Mercury Trine Jupiter (orb 8°)\n   • Venus Sextile Uranus (orb 2°)\n   • Venus Conjunction Neptune (orb 2°)\n   • Venus Conjunction North Node (orb 4°)\n   • Venus Sextile Pluto (orb 6°)\n   • Moon Trine Jupiter (orb 5°)\n\n5. Key Aspects Involving the 7th House Ruler (Saturn, and modern co-ruler Uranus):\n   • Mars Sextile Uranus (orb 2°)\n   • Saturn Sextile MC (orb 1°)\n   • Saturn Sextile Uranus (orb 6°)\n   • Uranus Square Ascendant (orb 1°)\n\n6. Notable House Placements for Possible Timing Indicators:\n   • Moon in Aquarius (6th house) can be used for the timing measure when it applies to or separates from significant aspects with the 7th house ruler (Saturn) or the universal communication ruler (Mercury).\n   • Mercury in Aquarius (6th house) and its upcoming aspects or separations from Saturn or the Moon can be closely examined to identify communication triggers.\n   • Saturn in Pisces (8th house) and any lunar contact via aspect can indicate developments regarding the other individual.\n\n7. Additional Observations for Horary Context:\n   • The chart is a Bowl shape, suggesting focus on one side of the chart.\n   • Uranus on the Midheaven might highlight sudden or unexpected public developments; relevant in horary for surprises or swift changes.\n   • Mercury’s conjunction with Pluto could imply deeper or transformative communications once contact does occur.\n   • The Moon’s final aspects before leaving its sign can also be checked: Moon (16°25′ Aquarius) eventually leaves Aquarius at 30°—as the Moon moves, note which relevant planet it aspects last while still in Aquarius.\n\nThese are the primary horary elements needed to determine and time Stefan’s potential initiation of private contact. You can now use this itemized data to proceed with any step-by-step interpretation based strictly on horary methodology.","gen_started":"2025-01-31T13:05:28.098Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-31T13:05:51.375Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a methodical outline of the primary horary components relevant for analyzing timing and communication.

All references come from the chart as given, with standard horary considerations:\n\n1. Confirm the Question and Chart Focus\n   • The question is: “At what exact day and hour will Stefan first initiate private contact with me?”\n   • The querent is represented by the 1st house (24° Leo), with its ruler the Sun at 10°19′ Aquarius.\n   • Stefan is represented by the 7th house (24° Aquarius), with its traditional ruler Saturn at 17°12′ Pisces (8th house).\n   • Mercury (3°3′ Aquarius) and the 3rd house (13° Libra, ruler Venus at 25°49′ Pisces) signify communication.\n\n2. Locate the Moon and Analyze Its Next Major Aspect\n   • The Moon is at 16°25′ Aquarius in the 6th house, co-significator for the querent and a primary timer in horary.\n   • The Moon’s next major applying aspect (by degree) is a square to Uranus at 23°15′ Taurus (retrograde), with a gap of roughly 7 degrees.\n   • Both the Moon and Uranus are in fixed signs (Aquarius and Taurus). In horary, when the Moon applies to an aspect in fixed signs, it often indicates timing measured in weeks or months per degree, depending on context.\n\n3. Converting the Aspect’s Degrees to Time\n   • With about 7 degrees between the Moon and Uranus, and each body in fixed signs, a commonly used ratio is 1 degree = 1 week.\n   • This suggests an approximate 7-week interval from the chart’s date and time (January 29, 2025, 6:52 PM).\n\n4. Estimating the Day and Hour\n   • Adding approximately 7 weeks to January 29, 2025, lands around mid-March 2025.\n   • Maintaining the same hour reference from the chart (6:52 PM) is a typical horary practice if no other indicators suggest a different hour.\n   • That places the likely timing around March 19, 2025, near 6:52 PM local time.\n\nThis method uses the standard horary principle that the Moon’s next significant applying aspect in a fixed sign can represent so many weeks as degrees remain until the aspect goes exact. In this scenario, the rough calculation points to mid-March 2025.","gen_started":"2025-01-31T13:09:38.829Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-31T13:10:01.381Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Below is a step-by-step approach to determining timing from the provided horary data.
