Its presence suggests that the energy for communication is active. There is clear potential for messages or actions to occur quickly.\n\n• Knight of Wands (reversed): The reversed Knight of Wands points to a blockage or hesitation in impulsive action. Although the energy is present, the initiative is dampened by erratic or inconsistent behavior. This may indicate that while rapid movement is possible, an internal resistance or lack of clear direction may inhibit Stefan’s proactive contact.\n\n• Four of Cups (reversed): In its reversed position, this card signals emerging from emotional withdrawal or apathy. It shows a willingness to break away from prior disengagement and consider new possibilities. This suggests that Stefan might be starting to re-evaluate his current state and open up to communication.\n\n• Five of Cups (upright): This card highlights emotional disappointment and regret. It denotes that past hurts or lingering sadness may be affecting the situation. Even if action is taken, there might be an undercurrent of mourning or caution that influences the nature of the contact.\n\nThe combined reading indicates that while there is a strong indication of quick action from the Eight of Wands, the reversed Knight of Wands points to a hesitancy or interrupted impulse. The shift indicated by the Four of Cups (reversed) may compel Stefan to overcome his withdrawn state, but the Five of Cups raises the possibility that he remains burdened by past emotional disappointments.\n\nBased on these factors, there is moderate potential for contact within 24 hours, though internal hesitations and emotional baggage may complicate or delay the initiative.\n\nConfidence level: Medium, with clear indications of swift movement counteracted by emotional caution.","gen_started":"2025-02-24T12:49:23.680Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-24T12:49:35.430Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Melissa Gale, here is the analysis based on the cards you provided regarding whether Stefan will initiate contact within the next 24 hours:\n\n• Eight of Wands (upright): This card indicates rapid movement and swift communication.
