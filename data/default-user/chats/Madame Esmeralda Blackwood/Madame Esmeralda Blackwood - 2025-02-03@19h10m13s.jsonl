The 9th house, representing him, contains the Moon in Aries and Uranus in Taurus. The Moon’s placement in Aries indicates a burst of raw, impulsive emotion connected to a sudden experience, while Uranus underscores an unexpected, jarring event—something out of the ordinary that shattered his emotional stability. The square between Mars and Chiron further emphasizes that this event inflicted a deep wound; the sharp, militant energy of Mars clashing with the ache of Chiron suggests that it was both traumatic and formative.\n\nIn addition, the challenging aspect of the Moon square Pluto points toward a hidden, transformative crisis—one that involved a power imbalance or betrayal. Combined with the involvement of Uranus opposing the lower sector (IC) and reinforcing the feeling of estrangement from familiar, secure environments, the evidence suggests that the incident occurred in a context that was foreign or institutional in nature. Stefan’s past may include a significant health crisis or a traumatic encounter with a medical or authoritative figure while in an unfamiliar setting. This unresolved wound appears to have anchored his current behavior, leading him to overreact and assert control regarding his children’s health claims.\n\nBased solely on these elements, the chart indicates that Stefan’s current behavior is rooted in a specific, disruptive incident in his past—an unexpected, deeply painful experience in a foreign or institutional context that left him with enduring emotional scars.","gen_started":"2025-02-04T00:12:43.823Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-04T00:12:56.579Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The horary configuration points to a past episode in Stefan’s life marked by intense, disruptive energy.
