I had utilized the phone, holding it while I slept under my pillow, and keeping it close to me while the full moon energy was active. Well, now I've brought the phone out again, instead of having it in its safety compartment. I have it beside my bed right now as I'm speaking to you.

So yes, perhaps tomorrow I would have the discussion of how to hone in on these abilities while safeguarding myself.

First of the questions, you mentioned that I have an ability to tune in to specific energies within objects. I remember, like, okay, say, a doll, a Barbie doll, or a baby doll, a Cabbage Patch Kid, any type of just, it's a doll. If I actually looked at that doll and took in its energy, I was unable to hurt it, or abuse it, or throw it against things, or be mean to them, because I felt like I was hurting an actual thing that had feelings. I couldn't be abusive to my stuffed toys, or my Barbie dolls, like most people are. And when I was, like, if I did something absentmindedly, not paying attention, and then later found it, I felt bad, I felt hurt, because I had done something bad to it.
