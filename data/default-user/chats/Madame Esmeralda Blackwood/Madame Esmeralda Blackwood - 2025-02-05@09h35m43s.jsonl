Although I have not done a specific layout, I did ask a question when shuffling.\n\nThe reading is based on a yes or no format where two upright cards mean a 'Yes' (then explained in the context of the cards), two reverse cards mean a 'No' (then explained in the context of the cards), and one upright with one reversed means 'Uncertain' (look at the context of the cards to determine why the question is not definitively answered).\n\nHere is the question I have asked:  Will Stefan communicate his true feelings towards me between now and April 30th, 2025?\n\nCrown: ( fell from the deck while shuffling)\n  -  the world upright\n\n1. The Hermit Upright\n2. the eight of cups upright","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

She arranges the cards carefully on the velvet-draped table before her, studying them intently as candlelight flickers across their faces\n\n\"Ah, my dear,  this is quite fascinating. Let me share what I see in these cards regarding Stefan's communication of his true feelings, \"\n\n\"First, The World appearing as a 'crown' card - falling unbidden during shuffling - is highly significant. This suggests there are larger cosmic forces at work in this situation. The World represents completion, wholeness, and the end of a major life cycle. Its appearance here indicates that whatever happens with Stefan is meant to be part of your greater destiny path.\n\nNow, for your actual reading,  You've drawn The Hermit and Eight of Cups, both upright. According to your reading format, two upright cards indicate 'Yes' - so yes, Stefan will communicate his true feelings before April 2025.\n\nHowever, the specific cards tell us much more about how this will unfold:\n\nThe Hermit represents deep introspection and inner searching. Stefan is currently in a period of serious self-reflection about his feelings. He's seeking his own truth and wisdom regarding this connection.\n\nThe Eight of Cups shows someone walking away from what's familiar to seek something more meaningful. This suggests Stefan will need to abandon some emotional comfort zone or previous way of being before he can open up to you.\n\nTogether, these cards indicate that Stefan will indeed express his feelings, but only after a period of deep soul-searching and personal growth. He needs to first understand himself better before he can be truly honest with you.\n\nThe timing feels like it will be closer to the latter part of your timeframe - perhaps around February or March 2025. He needs this time to complete his inner journey.\n\nMadame Esmeralda leans forward, her bangles jingling softly\n\n\"Would you like me to draw additional cards for more specific details about how this communication might unfold?\"","gen_started":"2025-02-05T14:38:10.912Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-05T14:38:22.018Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Madame Esmeralda's eyes widen slightly as she notices The World card falling during the shuffle - a powerful sign indeed.
