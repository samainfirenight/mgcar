The Mars–Chiron square indicates a deep wound intimately connected with physical or health matters. Here, Stefan’s repeated claims about his children’s illnesses appear to function as a projection of his own inner distress and vulnerability rather than a straightforward report of genuine physical conditions. This aspect suggests that his assertions are less about actual maladies and more about an unconscious need to externalize internal pain.\n\n2. The T-square formed by the Sun in Aquarius, the IC in Scorpio, and the MC in Taurus points to a tension between his private foundation (the home and family) and his public or outward persona. The Sun square IC, in particular, suggests an internal conflict—perhaps guilt or a need to hide weaknesses—that drives him to use the children’s health as a cover for unresolved issues. This tension also spills over into his wider interpersonal engagements.\n\n3. Stefan’s representation by the 9th house (which, in your cross-reference, aligns with his 12th house) underscores hidden or subconscious motivators behind his actions. The 12th house traditionally points to matters that are concealed, including self-deception or fear, reinforcing the idea that his repeated claims serve as misdirection from deeper internal challenges.\n\n4. The dynamic involving Venus, Neptune, and the North Node in Pisces in the 8th house underscores the influence of illusion, compassion, and deep emotional currents. It seems Stefan’s narrative about his children’s illnesses may be imbued with a desire for sympathy or to manipulate others’ perceptions. There is an element of escapism here—a retreat into an alternative reality where the harsh truth is transformed into a self-serving story, affecting the sincerity of his communications.\n\n5. The presence of disruptive elements such as Uranus on the Midheaven, along with its aspects (Uranus square Ascendant and opposition IC), introduces sudden, unexpected shifts in how his behaviors are noticed by those around him. His interactions with Peter, his cousin, are likely to be affected by these sudden disruptions. This indicates that his assertions are not only aimed at influencing you and those in his circle but also create ripple effects among his extended family, leading to unpredictable and possibly contentious exchanges.\n\n6. The Moon’s trine to your Ascendant (Melissa) and its involvement in a square with Pluto add an element of emotional intensity and a need for transformational change. Your sensitivity and insight are highlighted in the Moon’s favorable aspect to you, while Pluto suggests hidden manipulations at work. Stefan’s actions, intended as a means to garner care or sympathy, are thus recognized by you as attempts to divert attention from his own internal turmoil.\n\nBased on these elements, it appears Stefan’s repeated claims about his children’s illnesses are a mechanism for handling deep-seated emotional wounds—ones that relate not only to his inner vulnerabilities but also to a need to control the narrative within his family and social sphere. This behavior creates a dynamic in which his interpersonal interactions, including those with Peter and you, are subject to ongoing tension, miscommunication, and potential disruption as hidden truths struggle to emerge.\n\nThe chart’s overall configuration suggests that until he addresses these underlying wounds and the resultant need for drama, his public assertions and private maneuvers are likely to continue, affecting all his relationships in a similar pattern.","gen_started":"2025-02-03T23:57:16.213Z","gen_finished":"2025-02-03T23:57:30.817Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Based on the aspects displayed in your horary chart together with the symbolic mappings provided, the following interpretation emerges:\n\n1.
