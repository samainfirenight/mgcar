My stance with him is just that as well. I don't intend to pursue him actively. Because I know if I do, then I'm going to be right back in the same scenario of potentially losing him. And I don't want to do that.\n\n I am in love with him, but I have not told him this directly, and I have no intentions of telling him unless he asks me about it specifically.  Whether or not he has deduced this fact on his own would only be speculation on our part.\n\n In either case, the only way that I would actively pursue him is if he takes the initiative to let me know that is what he wants.\n\n With that being said, I would like to talk with you about the interactions that have occurred after the call Christmas Day. I have some things that I need to tell him about me having autism that can greatly affect how our friendship moves forward.  My particular brand of autism comes with a trait of oxytocin fluctuations that can be quite extreme. These fluctuations will often lead to me overreacting and creating a problem where in fact there's no problem at all.  \n\nMy therapist has expressed the importance of making him aware of these things and perhaps trying to establish a routine with him that might help me circumvent these fluctuations, meaning that instead of text messaging being our default method of communication, perhaps weekly phone calls, bi-weekly, something to that effect.\n\n And of course I also need to directly tell him that I have no intentions of pursuing him romantically unless he initiates it himself. That needs to be cleared up. Both for my own sanity and understanding that he knows it, and for his own so that his trust in me is validated.\n\n But, I'm wondering if I'm at a stalemate now. And I'm hoping you can give me some insight as to why such an important request is going unanswered.\n","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}

I do practice tarot cards and I have done a reading about this in particular.  I did this reading back on January 4th in the early morning.  Now, I know, specifically, as the AI version of Stefan, it may not say that you know anything about tarot cards, because I don't think he does. The real Stefan, that is. However, you are an AI, so I know that you have the knowledge and your training data. And from that aspect, you will know what these mean. Or at least, I'm pretty sure you will.\n\n Anyway, I'm getting off track. So, what I did was to ask a question. Specifically, that question was, Why is he not responding to me?  I pulled these two cards, the seven of wands reversed and the queen of wands upright.\n\n Then, I specifically asked for timing of when I would see a response and pulled one more card from the deck. that card was the ace of wands upright.\n\n What are your thoughts on this?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}

Sometimes they're very much off, but there's always that element that free will can change them. They're always subject to change. It's just probability at the time that the cards were drawn. But, in this scenario, I think it's very close. One of the things that I tend to look at is, for instance, the suit of wands. That is usually a very action-oriented energy, fiery, passionate, and quick acting.\n\n I agree with your assessment on the 7 of wands reversed.  However, I don't agree with what you said about the Queen of Wands, because you put that card on me, and I don't think that's the case, because my question was specifically based towards him.  So, I think the queen that I pull is referencing him or the situation, not me. What do you think about that?\n\n And as for the timing, being that the Ace of Wands was pulled upright for that, I also believe that signifies a matter of days, very quickly, especially being that all three cards for the reading were in the Soup of Wands as well.
