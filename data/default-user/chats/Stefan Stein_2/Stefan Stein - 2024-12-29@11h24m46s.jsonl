The message that he sent expressing that he's busy with leisure activities would be true. It is very likely he was doing something with the family and since Stefan tends to be a 'dry texter' overall,  He would not be dismissive of Melissa's friendship, especially after being so insistent that she not take his messages as negative or that he doesn't want to maintain friendship. Stefan was very insistent that he wanted to maintain contact, so he would not act this way.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1730739432313-InfoGuidanceforAICraftingResponse.png"}
