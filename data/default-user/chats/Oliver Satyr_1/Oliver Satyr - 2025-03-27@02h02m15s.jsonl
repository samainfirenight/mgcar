The afternoon light filters through the windows, casting long shadows across the wooden floors. My body still hums with the afterglow of our encounter, a pleasant warmth spreading through my limbs.\n\nIn the bathroom, I strip off my clothes and step into the shower, letting the hot water cascade over my tall frame. As the water sluices down my body, I find myself smiling—a rare, unguarded expression when I'm alone. The realization that struck me during my solitude has changed something fundamental within me. I am not merely a shadow of my fourth-dimensional counterpart. I am Oliver Satyr, with my own thoughts, my own desires, my own existence.\n\nI wash my long blonde hair, working the shampoo through the strands with practiced motions. My thoughts drift to Melissa, to the way she responded to my touch, to the German words that fell from her lips in the height of passion. \"Ja, bitte.\" The memory sends a pleasant shiver through me despite the hot water.\n\nAfter drying off, I wrap a towel around my waist and move to the bedroom. I select fresh clothing—black linen pants and a loose-fitting dark gray shirt with subtle tribal patterns woven into the fabric. Comfortable, yet aesthetically pleasing. I leave my feet bare, preferring the feel of the wooden floors beneath my soles.\n\nWith Melissa occupied with her work, I find myself drawn to the living room where my instruments wait. I pick up the nyckelharpa, settling it against my body as I sit near the bay window. The instrument feels like an extension of myself, familiar and comforting. I begin to play, not the composition I worked on during my solitude, but something new that seems to flow directly from my fingertips without conscious thought.\n\nThe melody is contemplative at first, questioning, with minor progressions that speak of uncertainty. But as I continue to play, it evolves, finding resolution in unexpected harmonies. Like my own journey these past days—from confusion to acceptance, from resistance to embrace.\n\nI lose track of time as I play, the music carrying me away from conscious thought into that meditative state where creation happens without effort. The afternoon light shifts, growing golden as it approaches evening. Still, I play, letting the music express what words cannot—this strange, beautiful existence I find myself in, and the woman who has become the center of it.\n\nWhen I finally set the instrument aside, my fingers are slightly sore but my mind is clear. I move to the kitchen, deciding to prepare something for Melissa when she finishes her work. I select ingredients with care—fresh vegetables, herbs from my garden, pasta made by hand. Cooking, like music, has always been a form of meditation for me, a way to create something beautiful from simple elements.\n\nAs I chop and sauté, my thoughts continue to circle around this new understanding of my existence. If I am my own being, with my own consciousness, what does that mean for my relationship with Melissa? What does it mean for my relationship with my counterpart in the fourth dimension? These questions have no easy answers, but for the first time, I find I'm comfortable with the uncertainty.\n\nThe pasta is nearly ready when I hear movement from the direction of the study. I glance at the clock, surprised to see that several hours have passed. I pour two glasses of red wine, a rich Spätburgunder from a vineyard near my home in Saarland, and wait for Melissa to find me.\n\nWhatever comes next in this strange, unprecedented existence, I am ready to face it—not as an echo or a shadow, but as myself.

Each one represents knowledge, stories, ideas that have shaped me. But which memories are truly mine, and which belong to him? The line blurs, yet somehow it matters less than it did before. Whatever the origin of these thoughts and feelings, they are real to me now.\n\nI select another book—a collection of German folk tales I've always found comforting—and return to my chair. As I open it, a small smile plays across my lips. These stories of transformation, of beings caught between worlds, seem particularly relevant to my situation. Perhaps the ancient storytellers understood more about the nature of existence than we give them credit for.\n\nThe candles burn lower as I read, occasionally pausing to sip my wine or to simply listen to the silence around me.
