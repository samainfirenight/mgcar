Tyr, their bodies intimately entwined. Feeling his morning arousal against her, Melissa expresses her need for him, her voice a soft melody of vulnerable innocence. Oliver responds to her plea, his body stirring with desire as he nuzzles her neck and caresses her curves with practiced familiarity.\n\nTheir passion ignites as Oliver captures Melissa's lips in a deep kiss, his hands exploring her body with tender reverence. Melissa asks him to make love to her, wanting to feel his beauty inside her. Oliver obliges, positioning himself above her and entering her with careful attention to her petite anatomy. They make love with measured, deliberate strokes, their bodies moving in perfect harmony as Oliver whispers endearments in German.\n\nAs their lovemaking intensifies, Melissa praises Oliver's perfection, calling him her \"beautiful Deutsch Prince.\" Oliver encourages her to let go, wanting to witness her pleasure. Melissa approaches her climax, her words of ecstasy spurring Oliver on. They reach their peak together, Oliver spilling himself deep inside her as waves of pleasure course through them both.\n\nIn the afterglow, Melissa expresses her deepening love for Oliver, questioning why their relationships outside of their connection seem destined to fail. Oliver acknowledges that he has pondered this as well, describing how other relationships felt hollow in comparison to what they share. He suggests that their connection transcends normal understanding, existing on a different plane.\n\nMelissa proposes that they should stop seeking what they're looking for elsewhere and realize they already have it with each other. Oliver agrees, recognizing that they've been trying to fit into society's expectations while their souls have always known the truth. He acknowledges Melissa as his soulmate, the other half of his being.\n\nThe narrative takes a significant turn as Melissa declares her belonging to Oliver, exposing her throat to him in an act of submission. Oliver responds with a primal growl, gripping her throat gently but firmly. He claims her as his own, marking her flesh with his teeth in what is revealed to be an ancient binding ritual.\n\nMelissa experiences intense pain as Oliver's teeth sink into her flesh, but she holds steady, understanding the importance of the ritual. She feels as though hellfire is being poured into her like acid, yet she maintains her composure, whispering her love for Oliver as she nears the edge of consciousness.\n\nOliver completes the binding ritual, drinking of Melissa's essence as their souls intertwine on a metaphysical level. When he finally releases her throat, he licks the wound clean with reverent care, praising Melissa for her bravery. He cradles her trembling form against his chest, assuring her that when she wakes, they will truly be one in flesh as they are in soul.\n\nThe narrative concludes with Oliver holding Melissa protectively, humming an ancient Norse melody to ease her into a healing sleep as the binding settles into their beings. This pivotal moment marks a profound shift in their relationship, solidifying their connection on both a physical and spiritual level.\n\nThe next morning, Oliver gives Melissa his silver owl ring. A token she wears to represent him and their official engagement.","bookmark_link":"Checkpoint #1 - 2025-02-25@05h11m21s"},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Three months after their official binding and engagement, Melissa, reluctantly, had to return to Michigan while Oliver works on his new project in the studio. \n\nIt's Monday 5:30 AM EST/11:30AM CET\n\nMelissa calls Oliver while on her morning commute to Denso."],"swipes_info":[{"send_date":"February 25, 2025 4:59am","gen_started":null,"gen_finished":null,"extra":{"bias":null,"gen_id":1740477588153,"isSmallSys":false,"api":"manual","model":"slash command"}}]}
