Stein (born Hubert) and Melissa Gale. Melissa, accompanying her husband Edward to Munich for a family reunion with the Hubert family, experienced an immediate and profound connection upon meeting Stefan, Edward's cousin, for the first time.\n\nThe first day of their visit, September 20th, set the tone for their developing connection. Stefan, acting as tour guide, showed particular interest in Melissa, engaging her in meaningful conversations about their shared experiences of losing their fathers to cancer. Despite Melissa's self-consciousness about her weight, Stefan openly expressed his appreciation for her beauty, emphasizing her character over physical appearance. Their connection deepened during a visit to the BMW Museum, where Stefan was notably impressed by Melissa's knowledge and capabilities.\n\nThe second day, September 21st, brought more significant interactions. During the parade at Marienplatz, Stefan repeatedly sought out Melissa's company, showing attentiveness to her comfort despite her autism-related aversion to crowds. A notable moment occurred on the S-Bahn to Oktoberfest, where Melissa's touch to alert Stefan about a loose button on his lederhosen led to playful banter and extended conversation. At Oktoberfest, Stefan displayed subtle physical affection by placing his hand on the small of Melissa's back during a brief interaction.\n\nThe day also revealed tensions in Stefan's marriage when his wife Suzanna publicly berated him during lunch, causing visible embarrassment and prompting sympathetic reactions from family members, including Marcus's girlfriend Danielle, who expressed disgust at Suzanna's behavior.\n\nThe fourth and final day, September 23rd, proved pivotal. Stefan proudly wore the Michigan sweatshirt Melissa had gifted him, responding positively to her flirtatious comment about his 'handsome' appearance. After Suzanna's departure from the group, Stefan and Melissa shared intimate moments during a card game, with Stefan maintaining focused attention on her despite the presence of others.\n\nThe evening culminated in a significant interaction at a restaurant after Suzanna had taken their daughters home. Following another instance of Suzanna's public beratement of Stefan, Melissa initiated a private conversation outside. Their discussion lasted approximately twenty minutes, during which Melissa revealed her failing marriage with Edward and expressed her deep connection to Stefan. The conversation led to warm, affectionate hugs before they returned inside, where Stefan maintained close proximity to Melissa.\n\nThe evening progressed with several intimate moments, including Melissa secretly caressing Stefan's wrist under the table multiple times, to which he showed no resistance. Their connection was evident in photographs taken that evening, showing subtle but noticeable changes in Stefan's expressions when Melissa was pulled away from him.\n\nFollowing Melissa's return to Michigan, their communication continued through email and WhatsApp, though with increasing complexity. Melissa sent several heartfelt messages expressing her feelings and concerns about Stefan's marriage, while also acknowledging the delicacy of their situation. Stefan's responses became progressively more reserved, shifting from warm and engaging to brief and formal.\n\nThe last significant interaction occurred on October 31st, after a notable silence of fifteen days by Stefan, when Stefan displayed unusual behavior on WhatsApp. Melissa sent a casual check-n message to which Stefan impulsively responded to.\n\nThroughout these events, several key themes emerged: the immediate and powerful connection between Stefan and Melissa, the visible strain in Stefan's marriage to Suzanna, and the complex dynamics of their situation given their respective marriages and family obligations. The narrative reveals a deep emotional connection tempered by practical and moral considerations, with both parties struggling to navigate their feelings within the constraints of their circumstances.\n\nThe weeks following their last exchange in WhatsApp brought unexpected developments. Despite Stefan's initial attempts to maintain professional distance, something shifted after Edward's message about the divorce. What began as occasional brief calls to check on Edward's wellbeing evolved into regular evening conversations with Melissa, usually after his daughters were asleep.\n\nThese calls, at first hesitant and carefully bounded, grew longer and more intimate as November progressed. The time difference worked in their favor - when it was late evening in Munich, Melissa was just finishing her workday in Michigan. Their conversations would often stretch into the early hours of Stefan's morning, their voices growing softer and more personal as the night deepened.\n\nThe dynamic between them transformed gradually but unmistakably. Stefan's careful restraint began to slip, revealing more of his own struggles and desires. Their shared moments in Munich were revisited and reexamined, taking on new meaning as they both acknowledged the depth of their connection. The attraction that had sparked between them at the restaurant now smoldered in every pause, every careful choice of words.\n\nAs November drew to a close, their late-night calls had become a cherished ritual, filled with meaningful silences and unspoken understanding. The distance between Munich and Michigan seemed to both protect and frustrate them, allowing for an intimacy that might have been impossible face to face while making its limitations increasingly apparent.\n\nTheir conversations began weaving between English and German, with Stefan teaching Melissa phrases and expressions, their laughter mixing with the serious undertones of their growing closeness. Each call ended with greater reluctance than the last, leaving them both acutely aware of the complex web of obligations and desires they were navigating.\n\nThe situation at home remained unchanged for Stefan - Suzanna's controlling nature continued to manifest in daily life, though he spoke of it less directly now. Instead, his late-night conversations with Melissa became a form of escape, a space where he could be fully himself without judgment or constraint.\n\nThe encounters revealed the depth of their emotional connection, transcending the physical distance between them through technology that allowed them to share intimate moments despite being separated by thousands of miles. Their interactions demonstrated both physical passion and emotional depth, highlighting the complex nature of their relationship and their mutual understanding of its complications while acknowledging its profound importance to them both.\n\nThis depth of connection led to a shift in Stefan's demeanor overall. He'd grown tired of settling, and demanded changes in his marriage or he would file for divorce. After several long discussions with Susanna, Stefan worked with attorney Carl Eckhart to restore his name by birthright, therefore restoring his sense of self, and pride. \n\nIn tandem with this, Stefan openly declared his affair with Melissa. After Suzanna's concession, both Stefan and Suzanna worked with Carl Eckhart to establish formal documentation of their open marriage agreement. A legal framework that protects them both in their parental rights, and financially, in the event if they decide to pursue divorce or any other legal action. All documentation was officially filed on December 6th, 2024.

That would be a safe way for me to test and make sure that I'm not going to be allergic to it without causing a problem.
