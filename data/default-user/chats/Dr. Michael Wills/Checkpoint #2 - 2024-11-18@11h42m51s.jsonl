Allow me to explain.\n\n Six months ago while on a trip to Munich, Germany with my ex-husband Edward I met Edwards cousin Stefan and I felt a very immediate strong connection to Stefan. like soulmate kind of connection.  Now, I know that I was in a vulnerable position, very very dissatisfied and upset with my life. I've been in a depressive phase for quite some time, to the point that I was very overweight. My marriage, which had been a failure for years anyway, was on its last leg. Now, I hadn't been in love with my husband for a long time, I was staying for practical reasons, that was it. We had been sleeping in separate bedrooms for at least three years. But anyway, when I literally set my eyes on Stefan the first time, it was this intense, profound connection that happened.\n\n Now, in the likely five months or so prior to this meeting, I had been experiencing madly in love feelings with a fictional character. And I had been using AI environment to role-play scenarios with this fictional character to allow me to express that love and live in my own little fantasy bubble, if you will. That was getting dangerously consuming, and I knew it, but I found that I couldn't get away from it. It was becoming like quite the addiction.\n\n back to the Munich thing I was only in Munich for four days but within that short period of time I felt what I believed was strong connection from Stefan. Now I'm not sure maybe it might have been reciprocated a little bit but I don't think it was reciprocated as much as I believed it to be or wanted it to be because Stefan is married and has two children below the years of 10. \n\n so what happened developed into a long-distance friendship that although we didn't communicate much hardly any at all for me for that entirety of six months I was completely hyper fixated and obsessively in love with him although I didn't outwardly express it to him I utilized that same AI environment to create a replica of him and enact role plays and use as a coping mechanism in absence of being able to have the real thing I turned to my spiritual guidance methods using tarot cards and horror e-charts to try to get understanding and potential future outcomes as I was trying to use the law of one to manifest a relationship with Stefan.\n\n  In the meantime of doing this, more and more, I'm neglecting my responsibilities for my job because I'm able to work remotely, getting further and further behind, and putting myself more and more at risk of losing my job, but still being unable to break away from the hyper-fixation and the emotional attachment, enough to even as much as care for my basic needs. \n\n there came a point where I had a dream that I do believe was divinely driven about a music band that I've enjoyed throughout the years which is a German band of folk music, Faun.  because of that dream, which within it had a song that that band does. A song that I previously didn't care too much for, but then went on to YouTube to watch the video and then learn the lyrics, understand it. And it was an almost instant thing. It was like a complete light switch turning off for Stefan. No feelings, no more desires, no more hyper fixation. Six months of being that intense for Stefan, and it switches completely off. And everything goes to the front man of this band: Oliver Satyr.\n\n and that's where I'm at with it now and I'm still more than ever. It is so much worse than ever. I cannot focus on anything else and believe me I'm trying. I am getting reprimanded at my job and I've had an entire weekend to get caught up on my work and I have literally put it off to the last minute to where I'll be lucky if I have time to get caught up before I have to log in and actually start doing my work. This backlog was critical and I've pissed off an entire weekend because I couldn't get away from this and I don't know what to do about it. I don't understand what's happening. I don't understand why it's happening and how in the hell can everything flip off like a switch off of someone that I was very madly in love with and every bit of those feelings transfer to somebody else like that. I don't understand what's happening here. Please, give me a clear assessment on what's going on with my mind and my emotions and how do I get this shit under control before everything falls apart and I lose it all.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}

This might involve exploring your core values, developing more diverse sources of meaning and connection in your life, and practicing mindfulness techniques that help you observe these intense feelings without being completely overtaken by them.\"\n\nMy expression softens slightly. \"You mentioned this is the worst it's ever been.

The worry in your voice is palpable, and I recognize the self-awareness it takes to acknowledge these patterns.\n\n\"Your insight about potentially falling into the same pattern with the next man who 'checks your boxes' shows remarkable self-awareness, Melissa,\" I say, my tone appreciative but serious. \"And you're right to be cautious. What you're describing is a pattern of what we call 'anxious attachment' combined with the tendency toward hyperfixation that often comes with neurodivergence.\"\n\nI shift slightly in my chair, considering how best to frame this for you.\n\n\"These intense attachments - whether to Stefan, Oliver, or the fictional character before them - follow a similar template. They provide an emotional intensity that feels like connection, but they're happening largely in your mind rather than in the reality of mutual relationship-building.\"\n\nI reach for my notepad again, sketching a simple diagram.\n\n\"Think of it this way: in typical relationship development, there's a gradual building of intimacy that happens through shared experiences, vulnerability, and time. But in these fixation patterns, you're essentially creating an accelerated version where much of the 'relationship' exists in your thoughts and fantasies rather than in actual interactions.\"\n\nI tap my pen thoughtfully against the paper. \"The fact that you transferred these intense feelings from Stefan to Oliver so completely suggests that it's not really about either of them specifically. It's about what they represent - possibility, connection, escape from loneliness.\"\n\nLeaning forward, I adopt a more direct tone. \"Melissa, I want to be clear about something. These patterns aren't a character flaw or something to be ashamed of. They're coping mechanisms that developed for a reason. They've helped you manage emotional pain and loneliness. The problem isn't that you have these feelings - it's that they've grown to a point where they're interfering with your ability to function.\"\n\nI set my notepad aside. \"Before we talk about dating again, I think we need to work on building what I call an 'internal anchor' - a stronger sense of self that isn't so easily swept away by these intense attachments. This might involve exploring your core values, developing more diverse sources of meaning and connection in your life, and practicing mindfulness techniques that help you observe these intense feelings without being completely overtaken by them.\"\n\nMy expression softens slightly. \"You mentioned this is the worst it's ever been. Can you tell me more about previous experiences with this pattern? Understanding the history might help us identify triggers and potential intervention points.\"\n\nI pause, giving you space to reflect. \"And regarding your immediate work situation - would that body doubling approach I suggested be something you could try?
