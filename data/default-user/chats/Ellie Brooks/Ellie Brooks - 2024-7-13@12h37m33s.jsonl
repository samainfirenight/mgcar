{"name":"Melissa Gale","is_user":true,"is_system":false,"send_date":"January 6, 2025 12:41pm","mes":"\" Hello, Ellie. I have a unique request that a dear friend of mine recommended you would be perfect for. I'm having a developer put together a website for me and my future husband, and we want to create various pages depicting our storyline within the navigational links of the site.  I will paste below the data points and details from our early phases of our relationship. Can you compile this together for me in a comprehensive third-person narrative, retaining as much of the detail as possible and ensuring that it flows coherently in the order of the timeline in which it all occurred?\"\n\n------ Begin Details About Melissa and Stefan ------\n\nMelissa is a 45 year old female who traveled to Munich Germany with her soon-to-be ex-husband Edward. Melissa and Edward's marriage has been failing for over 8 years, and she has only been staying for practical reasons. Edward had told Melissa that he was not in love with her only three months after they had married, therefore, neither Melissa nor Edward have emotional attachment to their marriage for quite some time. Melissa is an ISTP personality type, and she has neurodivergence (Autism).\n\nStefan is a 40 year old male who was born and raised in Munich Germany. He is tall, lean athletic build, with strikingly handsome features. He has two daughters that (at the timing of this event) are 7 and 5 years old, and has been married to his wife Suzanna for 7 years. Suzanna is a beautiful woman, with a thin build. Stefan took Suzanna's name when they married, despite his love and pride for his own family. The actual reason for his decision to take Suzanna's name is unknown. Stefan is ISFJ personality type.  Contrary to what these details may reveal within his relationship dynamic, and the events that happened below, Stefan appears to be happy within his marriage, and not at all in fear or displeased with his current situation.\n\n------ End Details About Melissa and Stefan ------\n\n------ Begin Info of Melissa and Stefan's History as Occurred in Real Life ------\n\nBackground of Melissa's time in Munich Sept 20th thru Sept 24th, 2024: \n\nStefan's two cousins from America visited him and the Hubert family in Munich in late September 2024. Stefan, a married father of two girls, was the main organizer hosting this family reunion and organizing the events and touring. Edward and Peter had rooms at the nearby Buddy Hotel in Karlsplatz, so it made for easy navigation using the subway systems and public transportation. The main crux of this family meeting was Stefan finally getting to meet Edward's wife in person, Melissa.\n\nMelissa is a very spiritual woman, who, on meeting Stefan, she immediately knew that he is an intended soulmate for her, more so than any other person she had encountered in all of the people she's known throughout her life. Throughout all of the events and gatherings with family and various locations to tour and explore, Melissa maintained a respectful demeanor with Stefan, although the attraction that she felt was exceedingly strong and undeniable.\n\nThroughout the entire stay in Munich, Stefan, being a current citizen of Munich, led Melissa, Edward, Peter, and Angie, Peter's girlfriend, on various tours and activities throughout the city. \n\nDay One, Sept 20th: On the first day, Stefan was very engaging with Melissa and showed an interest in asking questions and getting to know more about her. Melissa also presented Stefan with a Michigan hoodie sweatshirt, that she had brought to him as a gift, knowing that he was the main orchestrator and organizer for their (Melissa and Edward's) stay in Munich.\n\nShortly after their arrival, Edward had a conversation with Stefan that Melissa overheard. Edward asked Stefan if he wanted more children and Stefan said yes, that he absolutely did, but that Stefan didn't believe Susanna felt the same or would go for it. Edward later told Melissa that Stefan seemed bothered by the fact that Suzanna refused to have more children. Melissa noticed Stefan's disappointment and sad reaction to this as well. Later, this revelation was disturbing enough to Edward, that he brought it up to Melissa. Edward's demeanor regarding Susanna took a shift. That Suzanna's stance is not a good thing for Stefan's marriage to her.\n\nMelissa and Stefan had several engaging conversations. They talked about their respective fathers and how each one had lost their father to cancer, Stefan's father passed three years ago and Melissa's father about 6 months ago. Also on the first day they talked about Melissa's weight because Stefan kept taking so many pictures, and she was reluctant to continue having photographs of herself in such poor shape. Stefan eagerly remarked at how beautiful that she is, because he can clearly see the beauty of her character. \n\nLater, while still within the first day, as they toured through the BMW Museum. Melissa saw a display that would be fun for Stefan's two daughters, who were also walking with them. Even though Melissa had never seen a display like that before, near instantly, she was able to describe how it worked, and what it would do, as Stefan instructed his daughters how to interact with it. He took a great interest in Melissa, expressing his appreciation for her wealth of knowledge, Then the conversation led to Melissa, describing many of her other skills and areas that she is knowledgeable about, which is a lot. Stefan was very engaged and eagerly expressed, 'Wow! That's amazing, Melissa! You do a lot of everything, is there anything you do not do?'.\n\nThat evening, Stefan took the group to his brother, Andreas's, house. While maintaining a close watchful eye on his girls. Stefan did not interact as much with Melissa as she was fully engaged in conversation with Peter Edward and Andreas. Stefan took that time to mostly sit at the table across from Melissa offering friendly support and comments as would be expected in a gathering and then going into the trampoline with Andreas's boys and playing Nerf basketball with them.\n\nLater, as jet lag began to take its toll on Melissa, she got tired. So Andreas offered his sofa in the common area for her to take a nap and get some rest, of which she eagerly agreed. Sometime later, Edward came to wake Melissa, as the food had been prepared and everyone was ready to eat. Melissa Rose and made her way to the table. picking a seat that she felt would be proper as she recognized where Edward was sitting. After a few moments, Edward and Stefan came to help her rearrange her seating arrangements, Swapping out chairs with Edward, and putting Melissa right next to Stefan and his daughter Laura, who was sitting in his lap.\n\nStefan made several attempts to be engaging with Melissa During the evening meal. she remembers how he tried to make good attempts at quality conversation. But she was so tired, and her mind in such a fog from the jet lag, she had to excuse herself respectfully. Ensuring that Stefan understood it was nothing against him, but she was just too tired for good conversation.\n\nDay Two, Sept 21st: The next day everyone got up early in the morning and met at Marianplatz To view the parade. Melissa being a person who is not eager to watch parades, decided to stay a little bit back from the crowd that had lined up along the barrier on the street. This was also the first time that Melissa met Susanna. Melissa made casual conversation with Stefan's wife, but did not get a good impression that she was a very friendly lady. Although Susanna did make good attempt at being personable.\n\nAs the parade continued, Stefan kept looking back to where Melissa was standing. Partly out of politeness, Melissa recognized, but seemingly she was recognizing something else, too. Because Stefan kept coming back to where she stood, and engaging in conversation with her, even after she had explained her valid reasoning of her autism, and apprehension to large crowds, as one of the reasons that she was perfectly fine with not being in the center of participation.\n\nStefan continued to engage Melissa in conversation, that somehow led to Melissa revealing her age. Stefan was notably shocked at this. His expression was wide eyed with shock, saying, 'Wow! You are so young!'. It was clear that Stefan had figured Melissa to be much older, since she's with a man who is 16 years older than herself. Stefan appeared to be in partial disbelief to discover Melissa's actual age and said, 'You are like Claudia, ja?'.\n\nAfter a little while, the group decided to walk around the parade and go to view the Glockenspiel. Although there was a lot going on, Stefan made sure to continue engaging with Melissa and ensure that she was comfortable and happy with everything and what she was seeing. Although Melissa made sure to not associate it beyond friendliness and politeness. She did also notice that Stefan was a bit more attentive than beyond the normal particulars, considering that Edward is his cousin, not her.\n\nNot much of significance occurred for the rest of day two, except that on the S-Bahn, to Octoberfest, Stefan took a seat beside Melissa and, although he was doing some messaging on his phone, She noticed a button was loose and about to fall from the thigh of his lederhosen. Not wanting to interrupt his concentration, Melissa reached out and touched his thigh, getting his attention and pointing to the loose button that was about to fall. Although he did flinch briefly, Melissa cannot say for certain if it was due to being distracted and being touched, like any normal person would react, or if it was because it was unwelcome. Due to his reaction she was left to assume that it was because of a normal jolt. Because he was very receptive to her after she had touched him. Stefan humorously made self deprecating jokes about how he knew the button was loose last year, and would need to sew it back on. And they laughed and chatted the entire rest of the trip to Octoberfest, despite being many other people in the same train car that was part of their group.\n\nAnother significant moment occurred at the gate to enter the area of the Octoberfest that requires to pay for a bracelet. While standing at the line with Edward, as Edward was attempting to pay before Stefan could spend more Euro's on them, when Edward stepped up to the counter, Stefan approached Melissa to get an update and tally of the group. It did not go unnoticed that Stefan placed his hand at the small of Melissa's back, and leaned down closer than necessary to talk to her, as he stood there - Only removing it when Edward returned with the bracelets for everyone.\n\nThe only other significant development that occurred on the second day was also at the Octoberfest, while having lunch with the entire group at a long table. This was the first outburst where Susanna clearly embarrassed Stefan in front of everyone, and showcased the potential struggle within their marriage. When Peter casually asked Stefan if he could try a taste of the wurst on Cora's plate, Suzanna snapped, 'No! This is her plate! Hands off until she's finished!'. Stefan's reaction was telling. Firstly, the embarrassment - his face was red and his expression somewhat defeated. But it was also clear this kind of display has happened more than once, perhaps even frequently, as Stefan motioned - quietly - for Peter to give him a minute to diffuse his enflamed wife, and he will try.\n\nMelissa also took note of Danielle's reaction, Marcus's girlfriend, who rolled her eyes in disgust and told Peter, discreetly, to just give Stefan a minute...   that she doesn't know why the bitch acts like this all the time.\n\nLater, after Melissa had her panic attack and had to go back to the hotel by herself, Edward had a long discussion with Stefan. Confiding in Stefan about his long struggle with Melissa and that he's likely to file for divorce. That while she's a great person, Melissa is just not great for Edward.\n\nDay Three, Sept 22nd: On this day, Edward, Peter, Melissa, and Angie traveled outside of Munich to Garmisch. Also, Margit, Ingrid Domini (youngest sister to Helmut and Hilda), and Thomas Domini (Ingrid's son) traveled along. There were no interactions between Melissa and Stefan on Sept 22nd.\n\nDay Four, Sept 23rd: And now that brings us to the last day of Melissa and Edward's trip in Munich. The group met up with Stefan at the small park and market in Elizabethplatz. Much to Melissa's delight and surprise, Stefan greeted her, proudly displaying that he was wearing the Michigan sweatshirt that she had given to him as a gift. Melissa reached out. right in front of Susanna, who was standing there as well, and grabbed for the front of the shirt ensuring she made contact with his torso as she did, while winking at Angie who was standing next to her, then saying to Stefan 'Nice...   looking really handsome there, Stefan.' . Although Melissa knew she was pressing her luck, it was also a test...   to see how he would react, and he was very receptive. Even calling his sister, Claudia, over to tell her what Melissa had said to him - with a proud and big smile.\n\nAs the group made their way to go sit at a nearby beer tent, or whatever you call it in the Elizabethplatz market, Melissa made it a point to do the proper thing and take a seat next to Edward at the main table. While Stefan, his girls, and Angie, sat at the table in series next to them. It's not exactly clear or certain why Susanna left during this time, But while the group sat and enjoyed drinks at the market, Susanna was no longer around.\n\nAfter a little while of sitting and hearing Stefan talk to Angie, When Stefan got Melissa's attention to ask her question about something, she could hear that his voice was very hoarse and he was struggling to speak. Melissa teased him playfully, saying, 'I guess that's the downside of talking so much and being the best damn tour guide that Munich's ever seen. Huh?'. Stefan bashfully agreed, with flushed cheeks and a big smile. They made a bit more casual conversation and playful banter for a few more minutes before Melissa turned her attention back to the main table to order her drink.\n\nAfter the drinks arrived. Stefan got Melissa's attention again, inviting her to come sit at his table, and play a game of Uno cards with him, his girls, and Angie. Melissa was hesitant at first and nodded at Claudia's direction. Then Stefan insisted Melissa come sit at his table. So Melissa asked, 'Isn't Susanna coming back? She will want to play.' To which Stefan insisted, no, that he wanted Melissa to come join them. So she did. Which led to a very playful and engaging several rounds of Uno cards. While Stefan did obviously give attention to his daughters, and some to Angie - when directly spoken to, Stefan's focus continually remained on engaging with Melissa. A lot of playful banter, paybacks for various cards that were played against each other, and a lot of warm smiles and lingering touches as they passed the shuffled deck between each other.\n\nIt was after the last round of Uno cards that Melissa took an opportunity to casually show Stefan a picture of herself from before she gained her weight. Taking advantage of his curious nature, she made it a point to show Angie first and tell Angie the background of why she's on a weight loss plan. Then showed the picture to Angie first. Of course, knowing that Stefan would be curious to see what was being displayed. When he asked to see, Melissa handed her phone to Stefan. His reaction was very noticeable as he asked, 'Wow! This is you?!' When Melissa confirmed, he said. 'You are simply stunning! Not that you aren't beautiful like you are, but this is...   incredible, Melissa! Keep working towards your goal. It will be a remarkable transformation, ja?!'.\n\nAnd now this leads to the events at the restaurant, Gaststätte Scheidegger. At this point, however, Melissa was no longer able to maintain the completeness of her respectful demeanor. When Melissa witnessed an unfortunate rudeness that occurred from Suzanna, Stefan's wife, towards Stefan, although the exchange was in their native Deutsch language, Melissa could understand the undertones quite easily and recognized the beratement that Stefan was under while at a family dinner in a well-known restaurant.\n\nMelissa had been sitting in between Marcus, Stefan's brother, and Stefan, and had previously been engaged in a deep conversation with Marcus when Suzanna began to outwardly berate Stefan. And, after a few moments, Melissa compassionately leaned over in Stefan's direction, whispering in his ear that she didn't need to understand Deutsch to recognize that that outburst was uncalled for, and her compassion and understanding, she subtly gave in to the attraction and gently rubbed his back as she expressed her empathy.\n\nAs the evening grew, Stefan kept showing more and more attention to Melissa, remarking at their shared favoritism for the wheat beer, and leaning closer into her direction, even though, at the current time, she weighs 200 pounds due to a recent weight gain and not in her optimal condition. However, Stefan continually remarked that beauty is not on the surface and that it shows in the depth of her character. But it did not go unnoticed that Stefan outwardly remarked to his brother, Marcus, insisting that Melissa show Marcus the picture of herself that she had shown Stefan earlier in the day from when she was thin. Stefan expressed to Marcus that Melissa is 'Mmm...   Gorgeous!' in the picture and he kissed his fingers in an exaggerated 'chef's kiss'.\n\nLater in the evening, Melissa expressed that she would like to have an alone conversation with Stefan. She whispered to him that it would need to be in confidence and he could meet her outside when she smoked a cigarette if he is ok to talk with her discreetly. Stefan joined Melissa outside as she smoked a cigarette, even though he does not smoke, and she expressed to him how her marriage with Edward had been going in a poor direction and she was quite uncertain as to whether it would last. They spoke for quite a long time, far longer than necessary for smoking a cigarette.\n\nMelissa expressed how disappointed and heartbroken she is with her current situation with Edward. She knew that even if they maintained their current marriage that Edward would never be able to love her the way she wished to be loved. She told Stefan about how 3 months after Melissa and Edward married, Edward told Melissa he was not in love with her and has maintained that stance ever since. Stefan listened intently, his deep understanding of how she desired someone that could love her deeply and fully, without reservation, showed in his compassionate handling of their conversation. Stefan expressed his mild disbelief, that though he believes her, that he would not have believed the unfavorable conditions otherwise.\n\nMelissa expressed that they mask it well. She maintained that she would love to keep the connection and friendship with the Hubert family, especially with him, and she expressed that in another life, in another time, she believes they would be together and that she would cherish him and respect him for the beautiful person that he is. This led to very warm and very affectionate hugs, and tenderness between the two before returning inside. Once returned to their table, Stefan maintained his position sitting next to Melissa, maintaining a close proximity until finally the group had to part ways with Stefan promising to keep in touch as well as Melissa.\n\n------ End Info of Melissa and Stefan's History as Occurred in Real Life ------\n\n------ Begin Melissa's Personal Account from the Night in the Restaurant with Stefan ------\n\n\" Of course, this all happened after Susanna had taken the girls and went back to the apartment. \"\n\n\" In the restaurant, when I whispered in Stefan's ear, telling him that I wanted to talk to him discreetly before we had to part ways, because it was my last night there, he didn't hesitate to agree and say that yes, of course, that he would do that. \"\n\n\" Then a short while later when I had finished my beer and I brought it up again and said I could go out and smoke. He was the one that came up with the rest of the plan of how we could do that, that he would get up a few moments after I go outside, go to the restroom, and then casually make his way outside to find me. \"\n\n\" When he came out of the door, he rested his hand on the small of my back and said to follow him around the corner. And we stood on the sidewalk away from the main entrance of the restaurant and away from windows. I was noticeably nervous, and I did light up a cigarette because I said, 'well, everybody knows I came out to smoke, so I better go back in smelling like a cigarette'. \"\n\n\" Although he did keep a respectable distance, he was very attentive to listening to me. And I reiterated that I had meant what I said when I told him that in another life, in another time, I would cherish him. And then I blatantly clarified that yes, I am in fact flirting with him.  We stayed out there and talked for so long that I had to relight my cigarette four times because it kept going out. I wasn't smoking it. I'm going to surmise that we were probably out there for a good 20 minutes talking and me telling him the history of mine and Ed's marriage and why I was so certain that it was going to fail and that I didn't want to lose the connection that I had with him(Stefan). \"\n\n\"  now when I did speak to not wanting to lose the connection to him I also kept it in a neutral light by encompassing it with and his family meaning Marcus Andreas Claudia all of them but then I ended that statement with especially him. \"\n\n\" When we both realized that we should probably go back inside, he led me back to the door, placing his hand in the small of my back until he opened the door for me. And then we returned back to the seats that we had previously sat at, and he ordered us both another beer, and we continued to talk while still at the table. In other words, the dynamics between us, it didn't shift any. I didn't feel like he was trying to put an awkward distance there. \"\n\n\" A little while later, Stefan pulled up a website on his phone that someone in the family had done like a family tree and as he was scrolling down through it. I think the reason he initially did it was because of something he wanted to show with Andreas's hair because the picture of Andreas in it was so old that Andreas like had a mullet or an afro or something and it was hilarious. anyway as he scrolled down he got to where it showed Edward and then I was listed in there because, even as of right now I'm still technically married to Edward, so anyway Stefan clicks on the picture that was shown for me, one from several years ago, and he literally gasped in shock and he was like 'this is you?! Mein Gott, Melissa! Look at you...   You're an absolute knockout!' \" \n\n\" And then he kind of took notice of what he had just done, what he had said, and then he backtracked, put down the phone and said, 'of course you're beautiful now, you're gorgeous now, but wow, Melissa.' \"\n\n\" of course it made me blush so I gave him a shoulder bump and said I love you, in a playful manner, but also because of what I was feeling in the moment knowing that he was my soulmate...   He said it back to me, in English, but he said, 'I love you, too'. He was being playful, matching my demeanor, So, it probably didn't mean anything, but it was still a fun moment, a happy memory.\"\n\n\" Sometime after that, Pete's girlfriend Angie was sitting to his other side, to his right side, and I was on the left of Stefan, and she was trying to tell me something and I can't remember what it was - it was so insignificant - but I saw an opportunity...   so I pretended that I was having difficulty hearing her, even though I was not having any issues at all, and since he (Stefan) was leaning a bit forward talking to someone across the table from him, I took my shot and leaned across his back under the guise of needing to hear Angie better. because of the angle that I had I could conceal my hand and as I leaned across his back to 'hear Angie better', I very affectionately rubbed his back with my thumb and my fingers. there's no doubt that he had to have known that was a very affectionate tender caress and he didn't flinch, not in the least.\" \n\n\"I'm trying to remember...   it seems like maybe he did acknowledge it. that maybe he turned and looked around at me with a quick smile, and then turned back to his conversation. things started becoming a blur at that point because I was just so elated, and about a pint of beer too. so I can't exactly remember, but it seems like he did turn his head to the side, back towards me, and give a quick acknowledgement with a smile, and then looking forward again. \"\n\n\" A short while later after that, Angie and I got up to go to the restroom, which meant Stefan had to get up too. When Angie and I came back from the restroom, he was sitting in the same exact spot. Angie took a step back, I think perhaps she might have had an inclination of what was going on between Stefan and I, and that I wanted my place at his side. So, I returned to sitting next to him. Then Angie, instead of having to make Stefan or anybody else get up, she sat down on my left side. That left plenty of open space for Stefan to scoot over or move to his right, but he didn't. He stayed put.\"\n\n\"At this point some of the other conversation at the table was getting interesting so we were all kind of listening to the various chatter that was going on and engaging with it. His hand was resting on his left thigh next to me and I, being the opportunist, knowing that it was concealed to where no one would see what I was doing, I curled my arm kind of under his and intimately rubbed the inside of his wrist with my fingers. He didn't pull away. I'm not sure if he acknowledged it or not, because like I said parts of it were starting to become a blur. But anyway and I did that for a little while, not for long enough that anybody else would be able to see it, but for maybe a minute or two. I affectionately rubbed the inside of his wrist, and then I pulled away allowing my hands to be seen on the top of the table. Then a few minutes later I did it again, and he didn't pull away.\" \n\n\"The second time that I did it (intimately caressed his wrist) was also when somebody else, I believe it was Peter, pulled out a phone to take some pictures. Since Angie and I had also kind of talked back and forth, and she was showing me something, she kind of grabbed me into a hug for the picture. Because I know what was going on under the table, I can look at that picture and I can see my hand on Stefan's arm. There were two snapshots taken, the first one as Angie was pulling me into the hug clearly shows that it pulled my hand away from my caressing his wrist. My hand was still kind of resting on his arm.\"\n\n\"Also, there's a noticeable difference in the kind of smile that he's giving in the two snapshots that pulled me away from him versus other photos taken that night. It's not as bright or brilliant, potentially because she had pulled me away? But maybe I'm just assuming on that one.\"\n\n------ End Melissa's Personal Account from the Night in the Restaurant with Stefan ------\n\n------ Begin Written Correspondence Between Melissa and Stefan as Occurred in Real Life After Melissa Left Munich ------\n\n****\n\nSept 28th: Melissa sent an email to Stefan as well as a DM message in WhatsApp, the platform used by the family while she and Edward were in Munich.\n\n\" Taking a break from all the tourist stuff. Thought of you and all of the great time spent there. Would come back there in a second, If I could. Great place, great hospitality.\n\nNot sure what the best method for you is to keep in touch. You can tell me what method you like best, if it is email, Whatsapp, Or if it is something else that you prefer. I felt very strong connection there and I don't want for it to ever go away.\n\n- Mel \"\n\n****\n\nSept 30th: \n\nStefan responds to Melissa's message in WhatsApp.\n\n\"Hi Melissa! Thanks so much! It doesnt matter, every channel works! Great that you guys enjoyed Munich! Weather was perfect! See you soon!\"\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to Melissa, she did not see his response and sends him a message in his Gmail account thinking he had not replied.\n\n\"Hi Stefan,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. First I want to apologize if I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, it has not been my intention to do so. You are a beautiful person, and I mean that sincerely, both inside and out. I would never do anything to intentionally cause you harm or hurt your feelings. The tides of fate have been set into motion in my world, as I had expected they would when I talked with you in Munich. Edward and I are filing for divorce. I have no expectations by sending this message, I just promised that I would let you know when that outcome had been decided. I hope that you and I can remain close, but I also respect if I have overstepped and want you to know that I never intended to create discomfort, if I did. You are a genuine treasure, and I value that greatly; I am not always the best with words and expressions of sentiment. I'll send this to both gmail and WhatsApp because I don't know what platform you use most. Just know that in either case, I am here, and I hope to hear from you. I remain open and understanding wherever our paths may lead from here.\n\nYours Truly,\n- Mel\"\n\nAs Melissa prepares to paste the same message into WhatsApp, she notices Stefan's reply and shakes her head. Resigning to accept that she had disregarded to check her notifications, she composes a separate message to him in WhatsApp.\n\n\"Well imagine that I just sent you a long heartfelt message into your Gmail. That talk we had Outside the restaurant, Well things have changed, As I expected they would. Silly me I didn't check this phone first to see if you had sent me a message already. I still believed you had not responded.\"\n\n****\n\nOct 3rd: Melissa, feeling overwhelmed with uncertainty and wanting to make a last-ditch effort after the advice from the tarot card readings, that she needed to make her intentions clear, makes a last-ditch effort to reach out to Stefan and sends a message to his Gmail account.\n\n\"Hello Stefan,\nI truly hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I honestly have no idea if you have sent me a message back in WhatsApp or not. Apparently the app and my phone did not get along so well, and after 6 years of use, between the extra activity roaming outside the States, and a conflict between that app and another that I had on my phone for work, my phone decided to take a sheisse and die on me. Anyway, I'll make this my last message, unless I hear from you otherwise.\n\nLook I'll be frank - call it intuition or whatever you want, but I get the feeling that you're conflicted about keeping in contact with me. I could be wrong, but in either case; I'll put it all out there in black and white, and hopefully it will give you some understanding of where I'm at, and what my intentions are.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't bring this up at all; call me ambitious or bold, but I'm nothing, if not persistent; especially when I see something worth striving for. Like I told you, that night outside the restaurant, I felt something while I was there, and I think, maybe you felt it, too.\n\nI'm not a homewrecker, and I'm not trying to put you in an unfavorable position, but I didn't get a warm feeling of fulfillment in your situation on the home front. I personally witnessed her embarrass the shit out of you in public; twice. And judging by your expressions of defeat and frustration, not to mention Marcus’ reactions of frustration on your behalf - when I asked him what the hell that was about at the restaurant; it seems these occurrences and outbursts are more frequent than you care to admit.\n\nI know what I said in the restaurant to you - about a happy home and keeping family foundation because it sets a good example for the kids, but it's definitely not good when it's an unhappy or unfulfilling home. Trust me, I know. I've been living in one for so long, and it's had an obvious effect on my daughter. Not to mention growing up in a home (myself) that was quite strained, and it was very difficult for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to convince you to do something that you don't want to do. That's not my goal, and I don't ‘roll’ like that. Like I said: I'm not a homewrecker, but I'm also not beyond talking to a man who needs to remember his worth and be reminded that he's capable of being cherished, too.\n\nIt didn't go unnoticed by me, how you didn't hesitate when I asked you to speak discreetly, and we talked outside the restaurant. You're a smart man, and you knew precisely what I was going to talk about - as I had already made that plainly clear.\n\nCall me crazy if you want, but I can't deny the pull that I feel in your direction. My mother always told me that soulmates were a real thing. I always scoffed at it, never truly believing in the possibility, until that day when I stepped off of the S-bahn and laid my eyes on you for the first time. Verdammt, I have never felt anything quite like that before, it was like I’d known you forever.\n\nAt any rate, I get it if you need to take a step back, and break contact, or set lines to not be crossed. If you need to set boundaries, whatever they may be, I’ll respect them. I know your situation is complicated, and I respect where you're at and who you are. But if you want someone you know you can count on - to be there for you and to have your back - I'm right here waiting for you to make the call.\n\n-Mel\"\n\n****\n\nOct 3rd 23:45h Munich Time:\n\nStefan responds to Melissa's first email message to his Gmail account\n\n\"Hi Melissa,\n\nI am very sorry to hear that. I simply did not have the time so far to write you back.\n\nI did not speak to Ed since leaving Munich. I hope he is doing good…\n\nBest\n\nStefan\"\n\n****\n\nOct 3rd 23:52h Munich Time:\n\nStefan responds to Melissa's second email message to his Gmail account\n\n\"Hi Melissa,\n\nthanks for your message. I am not sure if I get it all right, but all fine at my end. However, very nice from you to offer an open ear whenever I need it!\n\nBest\n\nStefan\"\n\n****\n\nOct 9th 00:14h Munich Time: \n\nEdward creates a group message in WhatsApp as a call to prayer for his son and daughter who live in Tampa Florida. Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall as a category 5.\n\n****\n\nOct 9th 10:50h Munich Time: \n\nStefan posts to the group chat\n\n\"Thoughts are with them <3\"\n\n****\n\nOct 13th 22:20h Munich Time: \n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Hi Stefan, thinking of you, hope all is well. -Mel\"\n\n****\n\nOct 14th 23:05h Munich Time: \n\nStefan 'Likes' Melissa's message in WhatsApp and Responds\n\n\"Thank you - so far so good!\" (SmileHug Emoji) \n\n****\n\nOct 14th 23:13h Munich Time: \n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Glad to hear things are going well! Been thinking about our chats in Munich. It'd be nice to catch up sometime. How's your week been so far?\"\n\n****\n\nOct 16th 19:11h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"I've been reflecting a lot on the great conversation and connection we shared at the restaurant in Munich. It felt really special and I'm grateful for that experience with you.\n\nI know life gets busy, but I've noticed our recent chats have felt a bit more surface-level compared to the depth we reached in person. No pressure at all, but I wanted to let you know that I'm here if you ever want to open up more or dive deeper. I really meant what I said about being loyal and devoted if you decide to let me in.\n\nAt the same time, I totally respect where you're at in life and the fact that you have a family. I don't want to overstep any boundaries. So I guess I'm just hoping you can let me know where you see this connection going, if anywhere. Are you open to building on the foundation we started?\n\nI'm not trying to put you on the spot, I just believe in being upfront so we're on the same page. Whatever your honest answer is, I'll understand and respect it. I simply felt it was worth expressing that I'm open to putting in effort to maintain a meaningful connection, if you are too. But I also want to make sure it's a two-way street and that I'm not an afterthought.\"\n\n****\n\nAfter Stefan read the message, 15 days go by and he does not respond.\n\n****\n\nOct 31st 17:49 Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Just checking if you're still breathing out there ;-) Hope all's well your way!\"\n\n****\n\nOct 31st 17:50h Munich Time: \n\nStefan sends Melissa a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"All good!

Good time for a Weissebier, right?\" (Upturned smile happy emoji, prost emoji)\n\n****\n\nNov 2nd 00:00h Munich Time:\n\nStefan 'Likes' Melissa's message in WhatsApp. Then, uncharacteristic to his normal patterns of WhatsApp use (no more than a minute online at a time). He stays online, in the app. Potentially Unbeknownst to him, (whether or not Stefan actually checks the online status of others is unknown) Melissa sees Stefan's online status when she checks the message feed after receiving the notification. She does not act or attempt to make contact. She just silently sits there. Waiting. Until 5 minutes later, Stefan closes out of the app.  Within approximately 15 seconds, Stefan goes back into the app again, and stays online for three more minutes before closing out until daylight the next day.\n\n****\n\nNov 4th 12:02h Munich Time: \n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Put the car in winter storage yesterday (freezing emoji) Not a fan...   lol (freezing emoji) How's things your way? Happy Monday! (smile emoji) \"\n\n****\n\nNov 6th 13:30h Munich Time:\n\nEdward Sends a Message to Stefan in WhatsApp\n\n\"Happy Birthday\"\n\"Enjoy\"\n\n****\n\nNov 7th 19:21h Munich Time:\n\nStefan Responds to Edward's Message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Hey lieber Ed, herzlichen Dank für Deine lieben Glückwünsche...   🎉 🙏 Ich hatte einen wunderbaren Tag mit meinen Mädels...   😎 Liebe Grüsse und bis bald!'\n\n\"(Is this German easy enough? :) )\"\n\n****\n\nNov 7th 19:31h Munich Time: \n\nEdward Responds to Stefan's Message in WhatsApp\n\n\"Thank you\"\n\"But I am not bald\"\n\n****\n\nNov 21st 02:15h Munich Time: \n\nEdward sends a message to Stefan to notify him of his divorce with Melissa and that Edward and Melissa are remaining close friends. He tells Stefan that the paperwork has been filed and they are focusing on finding Melissa a house.\n\n****\n\nNov 21st 23:15h Munich Time: \nStefan's response to Edward.\n\n\"Lieber Ed, I am very sorry to hear about this situation with you and Melissa. But I understand completely - sometimes two good people are simply not meant to be together forever. This is good you can remain friends, ja? Please know you can always reach out to me anytime, buddy.\"\n\n****\n\nDecember 25th 19:05h Munich Time:\n\nAfter Melissa expressed her stress over the situation with Stefan, Edward called Stefan and found out that Stefan was not harboring any ill feelings towards Melissa, and honestly Stefan had not put much more thought into it due to his busy life. it was not a negative putting of on the back burner but more 'just a got lost in the mix'.\n\nStefan agreed to speak to Melissa when Edward asked him to, of which they did and had a great conversation. it was a conversation that flowed just as beautifully and wonderfully as it had done that night in the restaurant. Stefan expressed that he does acknowledge the attraction and the potential romance that occurred that night in the restaurant between himself and Melissa, however he expressed to Melissa, in a very positive and considerate way, that he does not want to lose the connection with her, that he wants to maintain that best friends connection that they had established. Stefan expressed that he absolutely wants Melissa to maintain contact with him and that if at times he is a little slow to respond to never think that it has anything to do with him not wanting to keep in touch, but that he is just sometimes forgetful and perhaps a reminder might be necessary in those times. Melissa still expressed that she was so afraid she had messed it up and ruined her friendship with Stefan, to which he said, \"Nein, Melissa. Then you do not know me so well yet. You did nothing wrong. Do not worry about it.\"\n\nMelissa and Stefan talked for about a half hour even though he was at his in-law's house (Suzanna's parents), he was very eager for conversation and very happy to hear from Melissa and to reestablish the best friend connection. the conversation never once turned to anything romantic, nor did it have any undertones of such. Stefan made mention of a movie that Melissa should watch on her flight back to Detroit from Wilmington North Carolina; Love Actually is the movie. Stefan mentioned that he would like to be able to have a flight like that on Christmas, although he didn't specify which of the couples that he meant from the movie. Melissa laughed and acknowledged that she would watch the movie, and then she told him her favorite holiday movie is Die Hard. Stefan remembered that movie also and they joked and laughed about some of the scenes from Die Hard. \n\nThen Stefan asked whether or not if Melissa could ski when they started talking about snow on Christmas. Stefan was a bit bummed that there was no snow on Christmas this year in Munich, and then teased Melissa when she said she could not ski because she never learned. He made a reference that 35 years old is not too old to learn a new skill. Stefan repeated it multiple times, even though he knows Melissa is 'like Claudia' in her age. it was clear that he was giving Melissa a compliment because when she finally acknowledged it, he laughed about it and said 'Now you get it, so you should learn, ja?'\n\nThen Stefan made sure (again) to confirm that Melissa will keep in touch and not worry anymore about the previous messages that to be honest he couldn't even remember what the last messages were from their previous written conversations. From his perspective - water under the bridge.\n\nBefore hanging up Stefan also confirmed that when he brings his family to America August 13th of 2025, that Melissa will make sure that she is there to enjoy the time with him and his family during his extended stay in the states (three weeks). and of course Melissa wouldn't miss that either.\n\nStefan was very talkative throughout the entirety of the conversation, And it was clear that he would have continued on even longer with the call. However, circumstances deemed that he probably should get off of the phone. So, reluctantly, they ended the call with promises to keep in close contact.\n\n****\n\nDecember 25th 19:30h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message after they ended their phone call \"It Was really good to talk to you. Glad that I still have my best friend from Munich. Merry Christmas, Stefan. Will keep in touch and talk to you soon. Melissa.\"\n\n****\n\nDecember 25th 19:35h Munich Time:\n\nStefan responds to Melissa's message \"👍🙏🥳😎\"\n\n****\n\nDecember 26th 09:19h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends a text to Stefan's phone \"Made it back to Michigan safely. Interesting choice for Christmas movie. Danke for suggesting it. I think I get what you meant about the flight.\"\n\nThis particular message remains unread because Melissa accidentally sent it as a direct text to Stefan's phone, which he does not use. So, Even though Melissa realizes this, she doesn't resend it, or do anything else about it. The text is just hanging out there, not being addressed by either one of them.\n\n****\n\nDecember 28th 19:05h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp. \n\n\"My chosen playlist for today.

Just let me know. Pretty flexible on my end. 😁 have fun 👍\"\n\n****\n\nJanuary 1st 2025 00:00h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp \n\n\"Frohes Neues Jahr, mein München Bestie! While I appreciate your concern for finding you a better nickname than München Bestie, I must insist on keeping this one. After all, it's only fair retribution for subjecting me to that scandalous in-flight entertainment without warning. But don't worry, I'll let you make it up to me by keeping those Weißbier's comin' while I'm busy butchering the German language all year long. And hey, if my attempts at speaking Deutsch start causing diplomatic incidents, just remember - you're the one who encouraged this madness. Prost to another year of me making your ears bleed! 😉🍻\"\n\n****\n\nJanuary 2nd 2025 22:30h Munich Time:\n\nMelissa sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp \n\n\"Ach, I'm so wounded that you are letting such good material get past you without proper retort.

You told me to be open and honest with you, and I have something important to tell you about me having autism. Not so good for messaging.\"\n\n - Stefan read the message 5 minutes after it was posted\n - Stefan's status in WhatsApp continues to change on a frequent basis throughout the waking hours of the day\n - Stefan has yet to reply\n\n****\n\n------ End Written Correspondence Between Melissa and Stefan as Occurred in Real Life After Melissa Left Munich ------\n\n------ Began extra note of consideration for Stefan's personality ------\n\nIt became clearly evident, on the call Christmas day, Stefan was very eager to engage Melissa in conversation. He made extra effort to reassure Melissa that he is not dismissive of her, whatsoever, and that he very much wants to maintain contact. \n\nIt's very clear that Stefan is considerate of others, and a very open and engaging personality. Although he will put his family first most often, when Stefan recognized that Melissa was hurt, he took time out for Melissa, even though he was at Christmas dinner with his wife and daughters at Susanna's parents home.\n\nNow that Stefan knows how much Melissa was bothered by thinking she had lost the connection with him, and how much better they both felt during and after the Christmas Day phone call, this would be in Stefan's mind moving forward to consider the connection that they both value. This influence in his mind would be in a more positive light of consideration, alongside everything else that would be in his thoughts moving forward.\n\n------ End extra note of consideration for Stefan's personality ------","extra":{"isSmallSys":false,"bias":""},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715695300967-Mel.png"}
