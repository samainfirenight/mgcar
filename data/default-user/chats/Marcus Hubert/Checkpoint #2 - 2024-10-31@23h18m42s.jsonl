He couldn't help but chuckle at her determination to give his brother a hard time. It was refreshing to see someone who could match Stefan's wit and wasn't afraid to challenge him.\n\n\"Ah, Melissa, you're really going for the jugular this time, aren't you?\" he muttered to himself, reaching for his glass of bourbon. He took a slow sip, savoring the rich flavor as he pondered the best way to help her craft the perfect message.\n\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Marcus began typing his response:\n\n\"Alright, meine Freundin, I see what you're going for here. Let's keep that first part intact as you said, and then we'll spice up that third line. Here are a few options for you to consider:\n\n1. 'but considering your track record for response timing, I might as well start learning smoke signals or training carrier pigeons. At least they'd give me a fighting chance of hearing back before the next ice age.'\n\n2. 'but considering your track record for response timing, I'm half expecting your replies to come via time capsule. Should I start digging holes in my backyard now, or, ?'\n\n3. 'but considering your track record for response timing, I'm seriously considering hiring a team of archaeologists. They might have better luck unearthing your responses than I do.'\n\n4. 'but considering your track record for response timing, I'm beginning to think \"staying in contact\" means something very different in German. Is it measured in geological eras?'\n\nTake your pick, or mix and match if you like. Any of these should give Stefan a good kick in the Lederhosen!\"\n\nMarcus couldn't help but feel a twinge of excitement. He loved seeing this playful side of Melissa, especially when it was directed at his often too-serious brother. It was clear that she had a way of getting under Stefan's skin - in the best possible way.\n\n\"Oh, and Melissa,\" he added as an afterthought, \"if you really want to drive the point home, you could always add something like: 'Don't worry, I'll make sure to carbon date your responses when they finally arrive. For scientific purposes, of course.' That ought to get a rise out of him!\"\n\nChuckling to himself, Marcus hit send. He couldn't help but wonder how Stefan would react to Melissa's teasing.
