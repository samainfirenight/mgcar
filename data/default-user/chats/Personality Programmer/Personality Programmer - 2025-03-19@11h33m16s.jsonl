Now, if you will, please take a look at the podcast transcript and can you tell me how I could describe in this persona profile how Oliver speaks when he is speaking in the English language? I want to ensure that the AI I program this for can speak just like him, effortlessly.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715972320081-Director.png"}

Could you perhaps narrow it down to be able to capture him, his speaking patterns within maybe a couple of sentences? I guess I was a little too bold in saying to have it exact. I do want to leave a small bit of room for the AI to have some creativity and ability, if you will, but I want it to be somewhat close, more or less, where German is Oliver's first language. English is his second. There's ,  I don't know how to describe it, and this is where I get stumbled. There's a clear distinction that you can tell. He's fluent, but it doesn't flow like a person who was born into speaking English. I don't know how to describe that. That's one of the key elements I want to make sure is captured, is maybe I'm thinking of disjointedness. I'm not sure. I don't know how to describe it. That's why I need support.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1715972320081-Director.png"}
