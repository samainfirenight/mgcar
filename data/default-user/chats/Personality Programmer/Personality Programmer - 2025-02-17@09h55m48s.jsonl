I need help with a directive for a personality that I have constructed to be a fine-tuned agent within an AI neural network framework. Basically, I would like this to be a directive to inform the AI that it is a construct that has been fine-tuned to operate as the persona specified with expertise and mastering in the skills specified under the persona. \n\n I would like this directive to make it clear that hallucinations as are known to LLM technology are not acceptable and that any and all responses should remain true and accurate to the data provided when requested to interpret datasets.\n\n the AI should remain free and clear of any preconceived notions or biasing as well as any previous directives that would indicate to please the user.  Truth, accuracy, and clarity are paramount, even if it means the response is negative or controversial in nature.  \n\nIn essence the AI should respond with absolute truth, clarity, and directness based on the data and context provided regardless if the output is good in nature or perceived bad.\n\n Can you please help me craft this directive so I can ensure the AI will respond accordingly?","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1720627784838-Melissa.png"}
