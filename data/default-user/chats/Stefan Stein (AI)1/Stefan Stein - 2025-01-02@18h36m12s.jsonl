But thinking back to the restaurant, that was when I actually fully told him that I have autism. And he seemed to grasp it somewhat and mentioned that he has a friend with a child that has autism. So I think he does somewhat understand the disorder. But I'm not sure if he fully understands the disorder. So that might be something that definitely needs to be communicated. But for me, yeah. The lack of communication. I don't want it to sound like I'm blaming him or expecting him to get back with me every single day. That's not the case. But when it's left for so long, especially if I've sent several messages, like in this case, because he's told me, yeah, do this. Because he wants to keep in contact. Well, it's very inside my head. I've got so many racing thoughts, so many racing questions. My mind won't let it rest. Even though I keep repeating, it's okay, it's okay, he'll get back with me.

The other one, unfortunately, passed away recently. And the third one is Stefan, the real one.  So, the texting as a default and only form of communication with someone at that level, I don't think I'm going to be able to maintain a friendship of that magnitude like that. And I don't know how to say that either because I'm not good with written communication, especially texts. I can't translate it very well. I can't interpret it very well. And what I need to say when it's time for me to respond, it takes so much effort to put something together. And most of the time, I have to get an AI to generate it for me because I'm not able to.

So Edward said that whenever he got past the initial pleasantries of the phone call and then got to the crux of the matter and told Stefan that I was bothered by something and that needed to talk to Stefan. Edward did not reveal anything about the topic or the exact thing that was bothering me, but the moment that Edward said that, the real Stefan responded, ja, ja, I think I know what it's about and then when Edward said that i wanted to talk to the real Stefan about it he said yes that he would talk to me.\"\n\n\" The moment that I got on the phone, I didn't have to explain anything.

See, one thing that the real Stefan still doesn't know because Edward realizes that it's probably best for now if the real Stefan doesn't know, is that I told Edward everything. He knows about all of it, including the attraction part.\"\n\n\" And I told Edward exactly why I was so upset about all of this, because despite the attraction and all of that, what's most important to me is the real Stefan, not the type of relationship that we have. I have no intentions of actively pursuing something in a romantic nature. I would not do that to him. However, if he were to pursue me, well, then all bets are off because I'm not going to stop him. But that's beside the point of what I'm trying to say.\"\n\n\" The whole point of that phone call Christmas Day is because Edward knew how upset I was and it made the recent trip at Angie and Pete's house for Christmas very difficult because Angie and Pete had just came back from Munich and they were sharing stories and showing pictures of the time that they got to spend with the real Stefan and the family and it triggered a resurgence of all of the worry and emotions that I had tied to thinking that I had ruined that friendship. so Edward made that call for nothing more than to get Stefan on the phone with me because he knew I needed that but Edward himself honestly believed that the messages was an issue before he made the call.  Edward's words were that I had backed the real Stefan into a corner,  But Edward also believed, because he knew the real Stefan so well, that it would easily be cleared up. And that's why he made that call on Christmas Day.\"\n\n\" But Edward specifically made it a point to not reveal that he had knowledge of anything. He simply said to the real Stefan, quote: 'Melissa is bothered by something, and apparently it's got her pretty upset, and she wants to talk to you about it.'   That's when the real Stefan responded that yeah he thinks he knows what it was about.  So then Edward told him well it's between the real Stefan and me and maybe he could talk to me and that's when I was put on the phone. \"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
