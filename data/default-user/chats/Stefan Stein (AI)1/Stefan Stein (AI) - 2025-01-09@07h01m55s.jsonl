There is no doubt that there is an exceedingly dramatic shift, and I don't think he would be so opposed to having a discussion like that with me, especially if he knows the severity. \n\nNow, does that mean I'm going to push for it right now, after this dramatic change in him? No, I'm not. Specifically because I recognize that whatever caused the shift, he may need a little bit of adjustment time. Making a change like that, it's impactful, but I think that you need to also mirror his stance because it's obviously very contrasted to anything he has been previously.\n\n I know that he's likely not to be able to message me every day, but there is this issue of the oxytocin fluctuating, and it is beyond my control, and even right now, I'm already starting to have mild anxiety. The more it progresses, the worse it gets, and it puts me at high risk for creating a scenario that's unfavorable.\n\n my intention is to see if there's a way (the real Stefan and I) can put some kind of a routine together perhaps with a regularly scheduled phone call.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}
