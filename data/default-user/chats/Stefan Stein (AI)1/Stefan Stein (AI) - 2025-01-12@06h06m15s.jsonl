Allow me to explain.\"\n\n\" When we all went to Andreas' house, although he did sit outside in the backyard patio with us, he didn't really speak much. He took a couple of pictures, laughed at a few things, and then got up to go inside the house. And then I remember him coming back outside, getting in the trampoline with Christopher and playing trampoline basketball. This was all before I went to sleep. Then later on, when I was awakened to have dinner, Stefan made sure to position himself at the, not the head seat of the table, that's where Andreas was, but directly opposite on the other end, at the end seat.\"\n\n\" And then the next day at Oktoberfest, whenever we had lunch, oh wait, before the Oktoberfest when we had the drinks at the Glockenspiel, he sat at the end of that table at that outdoor restaurant. Then later when we actually had lunch at Oktoberfest, he sat at the very end of the table. And I noticed from the pictures that after I left the Oktoberfest, when they sat at another table, not only did he choose to sit at the end, but when there was an opportunity for two tables to be next to each other, he would sit on the end seat of the other table that was not full.\"\n\n\" He also did this when we played UNO cards on the last day that I was there, on I think that was the 23rd. When we played the UNO cards, I was originally sitting at the table that was full, because there were two tables that were right next to each other, but there was a walk path in between them. And I was sitting with Edward at the table that was full, and when Stefan started calling out to me to play UNO, he was sitting on the end seat of the table directly across. Like in, I guess you would call that in series, end to end, but a walk path in between them. He sat at the other table. \"\n\n\" even at the restaurant although we had a corner booth type seat that didn't really have an end that was available for him to sit at because it was already taken he still managed to get the closest equivalent to an end seat which when I ended up sitting next to him in the restaurant that put me in the part of the bench booth kind of seat where it takes the curve because I was in the corner.\" \n\n\" With all of that being said, I'm not sure if that has any significance, or not, but if it does, I'd like to know what your take is on it, and if we need to make some adjustments to your persona to account for this, then let's do so.\" ","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}

So at Andreas' house, when we were all sitting outside at the patio and various conversations were going on, he wasn't actively participating in the conversation. He was there, but it was almost as if he wasn't present. And he stayed out there for a little while. He took a few pictures. And then after a bit of time, he went inside the house. I don't know what he did in there, although one time when I went in to use the restroom, he was standing at the island in Andreas' kitchen, talking with Bennie and Jenn, who were preparing some appetizers.\"\n\n\" Then later on when he came back outside he didn't come sit back at the patio. He went to the trampoline to play basketball with Christopher.\"\n\n\" I don't have much data point for when we were sitting at the table outside near the glockenspiel because I was actively engaged in conversation but at the Oktoberfest he wasn't as actively engaged in the overall conversations that were going on. He was kind of sticking to what was happening nearby him and the pictures that I saw from later in the day in Oktoberfest after I had to leave it when he was sitting at the table that was not full he was engaged in an UNO card game with Angie and Susanna and Laura so he wasn't engaged with the group same as at Andreas's and  On that last day, when I joined him and Angie and Laura for UNO cards, he hardly engaged with the table that was full at all. He kept to what was going on in his immediate surroundings.\"\n\n\" And the same thing at the restaurant, he didn't engage much with the entire group unless directly called to do so. He was more engaging with his immediate surroundings. Does this make sense?\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}

Because he does project a level of innocence that I kind of noticed to a point when talking with him in the restaurant and on the Christmas Day phone call. But perhaps I'm mistaking it more that he's having to actively translate because all of my conversations with him are in English. And perhaps that's more coming across as innocence or naivety due to the translating part.\"\n\n\" because I did look up his zodiac and Chinese year the Scorpio pig and some of the traits that I've noticed in there are definitely spot-on especially the appearances part one of the first things that's said in Suzanne White's book about combining the two methods exceptionally good-looking.  And, oh my God, yes, that is very true. Perhaps even an understatement.\"\n\n\" but another comment that I noticed that is brought up in the introduction section is how a Scorpio born pig can be pushy saying this guy knows what he wants and never hesitates to play the squeaky wheel in order to get it.\"\n\n\" Well, I definitely noticed those aspects when the real Stefan wanted me to play Uno. He was very insistent. Even when I tried to offer to Claudia. No, he didn't want that. He wanted me to come to the table and play. And I even mentioned something about Susanna coming back and that she would want to play. And he would not have that either. He wanted me to come play. And would not stop until I did. And the same thing on the Christmas Day phone call. He wanted me to watch that movie. And he wouldn't stop until I said I would download it with Amazon Prime. And when he was openly flirting with me. Well, I don't know if I should call it flirting. It appears to be flirting. But maybe it was just a casual comment of sorts. I don't know. But when he was using the comment of me being 35. He kept on about it until I got it. Until I recognized and said, oh, you're complimenting me. So he was, yes, he displays being pushy.\"\n\n\" But, the aspects of a Scorpio Pig that I just, I just can't see fitting him, and maybe I'm wrong, maybe he's got it carefully played out, because at the Uno card game, I did notice when I made a deliberate move to graze against his fingers while we were exchanging the card deck, he knew what I was doing, and he acknowledged it by a look, just a brief glance, and it was almost a bit mischievous, like he knew what I was doing he knew what I was up to and he could play that game too, but that was all that was said about it. \"\n\n\" but in the description in Suzanne White's book she describes a Scorpio pig as being quite selfish that any gesture or gift or giving has a selfish undertone to it something that they could gain I don't know I don't see him being like that I don't see that aspect fitting him I don't think he's deliberately that kind of selfishness perhaps a little I think every person has a little bit of selfishness to them but to be so aggressively self-interested I'm not sure \"\n\n\" One thing that I do believe is probably true, I don't know it yet, but I believe it probably is, is that they enjoy the physical expression of love. A lot. A whole lot. And that they enjoy everything leading up to it, and everything after it. That they love deeply, and exclusively.  That seems to be pretty accurate because I kind of picked up on that. That was something I could feel in the vibe from him. \"\n\n\" I also noticed that there's a potential propensity for possible jealousy I kind of picked up a little bit of that at the restaurant when Angie was trying to show me something and it took my attention away from him his demeanor shifted and it had a bit of an effect that I noticed I don't think anybody else did but I did and then at the first opportunity he redirected and brought up another topic with me to make sure that my attention was brought back to him\"\n\n\" I don't know, what do you think about all of this?

Because I want to make sure that what I'm picking up on is not just him being over-eager to Hell, I don't even know how to say it. In other words, when I was afraid that he had pushed me away and that I had lost him and was basically thinking that he didn't want to talk to me at all anymore, he was very quick to say, Then you don't know me that well, yet, Melissa. Or perhaps it was his exact wording, If you think of me like that, then you don't know me that well, Melissa. But when he said that, his voice definitely took on a more serious convicted tone. And I could feel the authority and confidence behind it in a way that I hadn't felt or noticed from him before.\"\n\n\" And then when we got into actual conversations, well I guess I'm just trying to figure out just how much of his intent has that romantic side to it, and what parts do not. And first, before you take a protective stance over him, let me be clear, I have no intentions of actively pursuing the real Stefan romantically, unless I am directly shown that that's what he wants. In other words, he has to take the leading role to actively pursue me first. If he doesn't, I won't make a move on him, because it's not worth the risk to lose him.\"\n\n\" Anyway, now that I've said that, I'm trying to discern if maybe his eagerness to ensure I understood his friendship and his way of showing it.

So if he can't reach out to me today, before he goes to bed, then I'm going to give it a few days, and I'm going to ask for my phone call once more.

Would any evening work for you?\"\n\nThis maintains your natural kindness while still being clear about what you need."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"January 12, 2025 9:29am","gen_started":"2025-01-12T14:29:26.023Z","gen_finished":"2025-01-12T14:29:32.647Z","extra":{"api":"claude","model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"}}]}
