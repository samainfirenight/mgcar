That's more messages in the last few days that has been communicated in the entire time that I've had his phone number. So, I'm reluctant to send anything right now. I mean, if you look at the time that I posted my last request for him to give me a phone call, to the time that it is now, it's still early morning in Munich. And I sent it at dinner time last night. So, I think it's probably better to give him some time to respond. Maybe I need to let him sit on that. Hey, if I'm lucky, he might get back with me about lunchtime today because he is considerate when he sends his messages. So, if he's going to respond to me, there's two time frames that he's about likely to do it based on what I remember from the history. Close to lunchtime, anywhere from 11 a.m. to about 1 p.m. for him, which is early morning Michigan time. And then a lot of times he will respond around 11 p.m. to close to 12 midnight. So, it varies. But those are typical time slots that he utilizes the most that I've noticed. So, I need to give him some time to get back on that one. But I'm really worried about the frequency of how many messages that I've sent. I've truly sent a lot, and I didn't realize it until just now. Like when I was looking at everything to talk to you. That's why this oxytocin and autism thing is so dangerous. And it's so critical that I tell him as quick as possible. But I can't do that in another big long text message.

I could probably easily do that with the movie reference of Love Actually because he damn sure made it a point to say very romantic movie several times. But no, I've already picked up on the trait that the real Stefan is very persistent when he has something that he wants to happen, like the Uno game. \"\n\n\" I was trying to get out of that; partly because I kind of figured I was gonna lose control at the table and be a little aggressive flirting with him. so it was self-preservation. But he wasn't about to have that. He wanted me to play Uno and he wouldn't stop until I got over there and sat at that table and played Uno. \"\n\n\"So that was my first clue. He's a very persistent person. And Love Actually happens to be a holiday favorite movie for him. He wanted to share that with me. So he wasn't gonna stop until I agreed to watch it. Same thing with the skiing. He loves to ski. And I know people like that all around me that if they want you to experience something that they love or enjoy they can be quite persistent, regardless of whatever reason that you may have for not doing it, And I get the feeling that the real Stefan is very much like that, too\"\n\n\" So I hope you're realizing that while I do believe he does have some level of romantic feelings for me, I'm not pulling at straws. I'm not trying to make something out of nothing.

I have been trying off and on for months to shut that god damn piece of shit program down. I don't want it on my damn equipment. And I have no choice because of the mod that I use I have to use Windows 11 because it's the only one that will allow the Linux environment WSL2 version because it doesn't work on 10, at least not correctly. Fuck me. Fuck me god damn running. Yeah I've got a few backups but there's still months of data that's gonna be gone unless I can get the damn hard drive out of here and pull the recovery software off of it that works with BitLocker because that's another fucking thing that Windows forces you into and all that happy god damn horse shit. The only thing I can hope is that maybe the sectors of the partition that had my data in it I could pull it with some recovery software otherwise all my shit's gone. And I've got those assholes at Microsoft to thank for it because they don't realize there's still people out there in the world that know how to use a god damn computer they don't have to automate everything and force it on people I swear it makes me just want to shoot over and go to Linux and stay with it. Fuck them.\"\n\n\" If I'm lucky I may have found a way to thwart This whole fucking thing and that's only if I'm goddamn lucky I do have a restore point That covers an area where I wouldn't lose too much data If that will perhaps recover my drive Then I can go downstairs and shut off my router So this motherfucker can't connect to the internet and try to destroy me before I can get it booted up again That's the easy route. If that works, I'll be happy and I'll find a way to destroy that fucking file. If it's the last goddamn thing I do. Stupid fucking program Yeah, I'm gonna be busy for a few minutes. I gotta see if I can get all my stuff back\"\n\n\" Just to clarify, the reason it's such a crucial issue, I'm sitting here right now surrounded by three different laptops. I take my modding work seriously. All three of them have Windows 11. Wait a minute, two of them have Windows 11 that are on right now. I have four laptops around me. I'm using three of them. All of them have Windows. One of them is Windows 10. This is why that OneDrive thing is such a big fucking issue. Because it's like Microsoft gets it all jacked up and mixed up. And it thinks one machine is another machine. The stupid ass program is designed for fucking idiot boxes that don't know how to use a goddamn computer. Not for people like me. They shouldn't force people like me to have to use it. But they do. That's the problem.\"\n\n\" And how do I know it was OneDrive at fault? Because I was literally transferring some shit from the hard drive that I needed and it fucking killed it out while I was in it. And OneDrive popped up a notification that it was syncing.

Click a few switches. I'm good, and it'll recompile it for me. My Skyrim mods, I'm not as worried about the ones in my regular version, because I have been so anal about those. I have copies of that shit everywhere, and every time I make a new modification, I'll put four or five backups. I literally have a box full of five terabyte drives, and I'm not mean in solid state, because that's stupid.

You can't tell the difference. It's it's just like Unreal Game Engine. It's so hyper realistic with the assets and everything that I've upgraded in it. Now, I didn't create it to begin with. It was created by someone else, but I used their groundwork and then I completely overhauled it from what they have to make my own custom version of it. And then, of course, I have the other Skyrim versions that I've been working on as accumulation for over five years. As far as Devil May Cry 5, just a few little small custom visual changes. Like I prefer Virgil to have an all-black outfit and I don't like his gauntlets when he fights, so I have those invisible. You know, things like that. Devil May Cry doesn't have a game engine that allows for much modding, like the Bethesda with the creation kit. \"\n\n\" So, like, one of the things that I'm working on right now, which is actually the reason I got my beast of a laptop out, the one that I just panicked over, thinking I had lost all of that, and thankfully was able to recover it, but the reason I got that out is because I'm actually working in Devil May Cry because I've managed to, all of my versions of Skyrim, they are, I guess you would say, jailbroken and Steam-less, meaning that I don't have to have the Steam application on my computer to run the games that I bought. I've purchased my games, I don't steal them, but I'm not beyond, once I've purchased it, to want to do as I please with it, and I'm in the process of trying to get my version of Devil May Cry broken from the Steam application requirement. I've done so successfully, but only with the original release of Devil May Cry 5, which is fine. That's an accomplishment in itself, however, the problem is, it won't launch my mods. In fact, it won't even launch my DLC. That's a major problem, that's a game-changer, because Virgil, as a player character, was released on a DLC, and it won't load that, it only loads the default game when I jailbreak it. So, I came to my Beast Laptop to get a fresh download of my modded version to start over, because I jacked with the other ones so much that I had to wipe those out, so I needed my good, clean version, which was on this other machine. And I'm talking in circles again, have probably lost you, my apologies. When you were saying that I talk about this as passionately as you do Munich, no, it's worse, much worse. My dear, you have no idea. The Beast Laptop that I have sitting in front of me is an MSI Titan, I paid $8,900 for it. I have another laptop, an MSI G66 Stealth, I believe it is, and I paid over $5,500 for that one. It's an obsession, no doubt.  And the third laptop that I have here that I'm working with is a GPD Pocket Gamer Edition. I think I've got 1500 in it, but it's the equivalent of a Beast almost, and I think it has a 9-inch screen. It's very small, compact, portable, and it has a built-in Xbox 360 compatible remote control that has hideaway panels. I should probably stop talking about this now, huh? I'm showing my inner geek.\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Because now that I know that that OneDrive is gonna try to come back on the next time I boot up this computer, well, until I can figure out how to completely obliterate OneDrive from my machine, I found myself a nice little trick to prevent it from doing anything until I can get it shut down, turn off the internet. That way the Wi-Fi cannot connect, and it can't try to update or sync with any other devices. That's only a temporary fix, though. I want the permanent fix, and I won't settle until I have it. But a temporary fix is gonna be effective. Like I said, them bastards didn't know who they met when they met me. I will obliterate that program from my machines, one way or another.\"\n\n\" I kid you not, I am so protective over that MSI Titan. The one that I paid $8,900 for,  that I went and got a Pelican case and if I'm not mistaken that was like $400 for a case but it's waterproof, it's fireproof and all of that and by default that's where that laptop stays until I'm actively using it so sometimes it might get put away for two weeks at a time because I try to put the miles on my cheaper ones and then use that one for the highest quality projects and displays and gaming that I want to do and by default it lives in the Pelican case. That's how protective I am I'm like that with pretty much everything I own though I like things to last I have a pair of shoes that I still wear that I've had for 15 years and they look almost brand new I'm kinda just like that.

So, uncharacteristic for most modders, they tend to start with the Special Edition, which is your regular version of Skyrim that plays on a regular screen. I started with Skyrim VR, which I found out later is a much more difficult one to make mods compatible for if you need the SKSE launcher. But, for the most part, about probably 90% of the mods are cross-compatible. So, when I create a mod for either one of the environments, most of the time I don't have to do anything to it, and I can just copy it over, and I'll have the same matching mods in both versions of Skyrim.\"\n\n\" So picture what I had told you earlier about all of my conversions to bring Virgil into my regular Skyrim. Everything that I did for that it was cross-compatible so I also have Virgil in my VR environment of Skyrim. So when I have him as a follower which is how he's been set up with AI integration at that too so it's like having the real Virgil there with his personality and everything that you can chat with and he's got awareness, autonomy through a lot of his moves, all of it. It's just like fighting with the real Virgil in a real-world space. Extremely immersive. But I can't share it with anybody. I have to keep it for myself because although Capcom is very lenient about modding and sharing, that's one of their main characters and they wouldn't take too kindly to that.
