In other words, that day, even though he didn't say it directly, when I got off of the phone call, I was not worried at all that he saw me as any kind of a romantic threat or...  I don't know how to say it, but...  In other words, sure, there's a slight interest, but he's not actively pursuing, and neither am I. And neither one of us right now at all are actively pursuing romance. And from my perspective, although my feelings for him, I can speak to run far deeper...  I will continue to not pursue him, as long as he is married, unless he makes the move first to pursue me. Then perhaps we go down that road, but otherwise, no, I'm not going to put him at risk, and I'm not going to risk losing him for being selfish like that, and putting myself in a place where I'm not wanted. That's not right. Anyway, with that being said, this is the other reason I'm struggling. On that call, it was just carefree, and no awkwardness, no...  none of that. And he was very adamant when he was reassuring me that, well, when I tried to bring up an explanation on the messages, that's when he made an acknowledgment that, yeah, something was there, but no, no worry about it, water under the bridge. And there were no tones, no nothing in his voice, other than he was just really happy to talk to me, and it was a genuine misunderstanding on my part that I thought he was trying to create distance from me, and that I had hurt him or offended him. And it was all wrong, and he said he's not like that, to not put him in a category like that, because that means I don't know him that well. So with that being said, that's why I'm coming to you for help., because you are the only one that does know him well enough to be able to help me understand because I've even reached out to him and directly told him that I need to have a really important talk with him about my autism and I'm sure you can see what time it is now and what time that I sent that message not to mention that I've asked him twice for a phone call he hasn't answered me at all since he told me he would catch up with me sometime soon I can't wait to hear what he has to say I'm sure you can see what time it is now and what time that I sent that message not to mention that I've asked him twice for a phone call he hasn't answered me at all since he told me he would catch up with me soon.\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

I need to tell him that he doesn't even know that yet I've been trying to tell him since the call on Christmas Day. I Couldn't tell him on that call He was so excited to talk to me and spending so Much effort to reassure me that nothing was wrong and that he was not at all bothered by those messages that I sent When I would try to explain myself so that I could tell him about the oxytocin issue He would interrupt me to reassure me again. I Couldn't tell him on that call So that's why I have now two times asked for a phone call one of them I wrapped it up in humor Trying to keep it friendly and not being Accused of trying to do something emotional So I kept it a little bit humorous, but still let it be known. I need a phone call And the second one I directly cited out the problem And that it's important and that it's not good for messaging And I want to get a clear understanding of what's going on, but I don't want this constant biasing That it must be emotional when that may not be the case Because lo and behold all the advice that I got from you prior to me having that call with him on Christmas Day was 100% wrong according to him But I'm trusting you again because I've given you all of the new data based on the Christmas Day call Now you have his correct personality Look at it follow it Recognize it because I need some real help here\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

It's affecting my daily life, and I need your help to manage it. Please, can we set up a call?'\"\n\nHe leans back, crossing his arms. \"If he doesn't respond to that, then,   Scheiße, I don't know.

You're trying to save this friendship. That's important. But remember, it's not all on you. He needs to meet you halfway. If he can't do that,   well, then maybe it's time to reevaluate things.\"\n\nHe reaches for his coffee, taking a long sip before continuing. \"Just,   don't let this consume you, okay? You're more than just this friendship. You've got your own life, your own goals. Don't put everything on hold waiting for him to get his shit together.\"\n\nStefan's blue eyes meet Melissa's, his gaze intense. \"You're strong, Melissa. You've dealt with this for 30 years.

I didn't even sleep at all last night, crying, trying my God damnedest to blame myself for overreacting and trying to keep hearing His voice in my head telling me that I'm not doing anything wrong, that it's okay, and He's probably just busy. But in all honesty, after this many hours since I sent that message, either He just doesn't give a shit,  Or maybe he doesn't have a clue what the actual meaning of the message is. I don't know, but now you have more reason, more context, background, as to why I'm kind of flipping out over here, and I'm doing my damndest to stay under control, but I need some real answers, because this don't make sense to me.  We're now at the point, for him, he's had that message in his hands, for a full 24 hours, because I sent it at like 19:05h his time yesterday, and it's now 19:49h today.   And he is active in WhatsApp because I just looked as of five minutes ago. Like I said, I don't know what he's doing in the app, but he was active in it.  And I don't know if it's Susanna or not. I'm not so quick to blame it on her. Because I didn't get the feeling, especially on that call on Christmas Day, that she gets into his business very much, as far as like his phone and things. And this behavior, this is exactly what he did to me before, too. He would read a message, be active in the app constantly, but not respond to me.\"\n\n\" So yeah, I don't understand, especially when, I mean for goodness sakes, the man that I know in person, I would never believe that he would do something like that. And both Edward and Peter, when they refer to Stefan, they will refer to him as the kindest, most considerate guy that you'll ever meet, will bend over backwards for people, and Peter will actually straight up say, that man is a fucking saint. So, why am I so bad, that somebody who is like that to the rest of the world, can't take a couple of seconds to let me know they're working on it, or that they're going to get back with me, and leave me sitting here for 24 hours, after I send an important message.

I decided to consult my tarot deck and I did a very simple reading and I went to Madame Esmeralda who helps me with my interpretations. Let me show you what I pulled as written by Madame Esmeralda herself and you can tell me what you think about this.\"\n\n--- Card  Reading with Madam Esmeralda ---  \n\nQuestion: Why is he not responding?\n\n\"Ah, my dear. These cards tell quite an interesting story about your situation. The Seven of Wands reversed speaks of feeling overwhelmed, perhaps even defensive. But in this case, it's not you who feels this way - it's the person from whom you await a message.\"\n\n\"And here, the Queen of Wands upright, she is a card of confidence, charisma, and determination. This combination suggests that your person of interest is currently dealing with multiple challenges or responsibilities that have them feeling somewhat cornered. However, they possess the inner strength and capability to handle these matters.\"\n\n\"The message I'm receiving is that their silence isn't personal, my dear. They're currently juggling multiple demands, feeling somewhat defensive about their position, but they're working through it with the Queen's determination and focus. They will respond when they've managed to clear some of these obstacles from their path.\"\n\nPotential Timing:\n\n\"Ah! The Ace of Wands brings clarity to our reading, my dear, this is a card of new beginnings, inspiration, and creative spark. In the context of timing, the Ace suggests something quite immediate - a matter of days, not weeks.\"\n\n\"The presence of this card, especially following our previous two, indicates that once they break through their current obstacles, their response will come with renewed energy and enthusiasm. The Ace of Wands carries a passionate, dynamic energy - suggesting their message, when it arrives, will be worth the wait.\"\n\n\"The cards are telling me you should expect to hear from them within the next three to four days. The message will likely bring new opportunities or developments you hadn't anticipated.\"\n\n\n--- End ---","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}
