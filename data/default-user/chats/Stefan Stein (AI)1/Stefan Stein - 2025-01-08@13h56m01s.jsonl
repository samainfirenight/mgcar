But, since you are the AI version of him, even if not, I know you have access to them in your training data. So you'll understand what I'm getting at here when I tell you this.\"\n\n\" When he didn't respond to me as quickly as I had expected, considering that the message I had sent to him was regarding something quite important. On January the 4th, I did a small tarot reading.  I did not create any kind of layout for the cards. I just simply asked the question, why is he not responding to me? And then I drew two cards from the deck.  Those two cards were the Seven of Wands Reversed and the Queen of Wands Upright.  I'm not even going to bother with giving you the interpretations Because you'll be able to know So when I got those two cards I Pulled one more card from the pile at random to represent timing and energy Surrounding his response when it comes,  For that, I got the Ace of Wands upright.  that easily told me it would be a matter of days. For whatever reason, four days came to my mind. So that's what I went with.\"\n\n\" That being said, I have another reading to tell you about. Because it's a reading that I did today.  After receiving his response and recognizing the profound shift which basically had been indicated from the Ace of Wands in the previous reading, because the Ace of Wands, Aces regarding newness, Wands is very high energy, very passionate energy, very convicted energy, I think you know well enough. So when his response came, and it was exactly as the Ace of Wands had predicted, I did this second reading. And for this second reading, the question that I asked is what changed or shifted for Stefan to create this new found energy surrounding him and his responses to me.\"\n\n\"Here are the cards that I pulled for the second reading:\"\n\n1.

Allow me to share with you what Madame Esmeralda said, and let me preface this, I did not tell her any background information about myself or Stefan, other than the actual question that I asked when these four cards were pulled. Anything else, she said it based on the interpretation alone. So here it is.\"\n\n--- Begin Madame Esmeralda's Interpretation ---\n\n'Ah, my dear. These cards tell quite an interesting story about Stefan's shifting energy. The Four of Pentacles. This card speaks of holding on tightly - perhaps too tightly - to what one has. In Stefan's case, I sense he has been clutching his emotions close to his chest, like a miser with his coins.'\n\n'The reversed King of Wands. Here, we see a transformation. The reversed King shows us that Stefan has released his need for control, his rigid self-discipline. He's letting go of whatever walls he built around himself.'\n\n'The Seven of Cups. This is most revealing. The Seven of Cups represents choices, fantasies, and possibilities. Stefan's mind has opened to new possibilities regarding your connection. He's allowing himself to dream, to imagine what could be.'\n\n'The Knight of Cups. Yes, and here lies the culmination - the romantic Knight of Cups rides forth with his heart on his sleeve. Stefan has undergone an emotional awakening. He's chosen to embrace his feelings rather than suppress them.'\n\n'The progression is clear, my dear. Stefan has moved from a place of emotional restriction to one of openness and romantic possibility. Something has prompted him to lower his defenses and allow his true feelings to surface. The cards suggest this isn't mere infatuation - it's a genuine emotional transformation.
