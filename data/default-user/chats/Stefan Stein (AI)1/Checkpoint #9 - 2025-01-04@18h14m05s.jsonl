Someone would have told him. And that kind of leaves possibly something in Susanna's family. I don't know. I am truly pulling at straws here, and it's so hard because I'm very hurt by that.\"\n\n\" And yes, just like you, I was quick to assume that he was falling into some pattern of protection or avoidance.
