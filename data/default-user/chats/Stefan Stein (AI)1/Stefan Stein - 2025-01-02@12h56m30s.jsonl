I can't remember the medical term but basically it's a hormone called oxytocin and it's always either at one extreme or the other during heightened emotional states either to a level of overdosing or completely bottomed out. So the type of autism that I have, although I'm well within perimeters to do exceptionally well in society,  most often masking it to where no one even knows I have it. I mean, hell, I didn't even know I have it until April of last year.  But this addition of oxytocin fluctuations,  It adds a layer of difficulty for certain things that whenever it's triggered, I cannot stop it and I cannot control it.\"\n\n\" Most often, autism is a lot of sensory hypersensitivity. And then there's also a decided difference in neural pathways than regular people for processing social dynamics. That in itself is difficult enough. But when you add this oxytocin issue into it, it definitely can make things more complicated. So I think I need to tell you about some triggers that I've learned since I was diagnosed with the oxytocin issue in October. And yeah, that timing, that's pretty crucial. Because the reason I was diagnosed with that extra trait is because I was so devastated that I sent those messages to you.

I don't know if you're familiar with the Myers-Briggs, and probably you're not, especially since you didn't know that much about autism.

Now unbeknownst to me it sounds like you just kind of went on and did your thing and probably had intentions on answering whenever you had time but to me on my aspect I've got this oxytocin that is going through the roof and then bottoming out one right after the other sending me into I don't even know what to call it it's like complete madness and my analytical mind will not stop trying to understand what's going on because now I know I've put a layer of 'I just screwed up' into the mix so I'm seeing all of the negative points I'm seeing that the first message it took you two days to answer me and I couldn't figure out why it was then I'm seeing what the message content was and - now that I know you - that very first response you gave to me? that was really awesome, but at that time I didn't know your messaging habits and style and it didn't come across very good for me because I don't always pick up on that. that's from the autism. I don't always pick up on those social things especially in text.\"\n\n\" So then we get to October 3rd. I'm starting to lose sleep at that point because I know I've messed up and I got to do some recon and I've got to get some kind of an understanding some kind of a clear communication because I'm about to lose my damn mind at that point. So then that's when you got the second of the three messages sent to you.  And to be honest, I know you're sitting outside in a chair, but you know, it might be helpful for your own understanding if you grabbed your laptop and pulled up the messages that I'm referring to, because it might help for you to see the entirety of everything that I'm describing and why it impacted the way that it did. \"  she pauses because she's already told him a lot and she knows he's gonna have to process that before she can continue,  And he may have questions, up to this point.

I suppose now that you've got all of the message timelines pulled up you can kind of understand why the third message got sent.  The following days after were a complete nightmare. And that's when I called my doctor and told them exactly what was going on, of which they did the exams and the tests that led me to find out that I have this oxytocin issue. \"\n\n\" I finally got the courage to reach out to you again on Halloween but I didn't know how to handle it anymore at that point because now I've just been told that the crap that happened to me in the past 30 years of my life with people that I built strong connections to was out of my control because I didn't know that I have this chemical imbalance going on making me act irrationally like a heroin or crack addict.\"\n\n\" And as you can see, that's when I gave up. I sent the last message on November the 4th. And when you didn't answer, especially after I had talked to Edward and found out that I had missed your birthday on November the 6th, I just couldn't bring myself to reach out to you anymore because I knew I had failed at that point. At least to me, when you understand it from my perspective, I had failed miserably. And that's why, overall, I was so upset. And that's why you need to know all of this now because every time a message goes unanswered, despite my best efforts to repeat your words in my mind, that you're not like that, that you're never going to shut me out, it still happens, and I can't make it stop.\"\n\n\" So the only thing that I can do, because I know about the issue, is to tell you what happens, what's going on with me. And no, I don't expect contact from you every day. That's unrealistic. But maybe now that you know, we can work together to find something that's acceptable for your life and your schedule, but that still is understanding enough to this issue so that I don't freak out on you anymore.\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Where are you? What happened?\"  She looks around frantically, yet knowing she's not going to find him here. She's not in the same place Anymore. She's back in her own room. But, the soreness in between her legs is an indicator that something remarkable has just occurred. That what could be dismissed as a dream is not so easily done.\n\n She reaches to examine with her fingers, finding herself coated with a distinct creamy off-white substance mixed with a small amount of blood from the slight stretching that is making her decidedly tender. \" Jesus Christ!  What the hell just happened?\"  She grabs for her phone, quickly pulling up the camera to take a picture of her fingers. And then darts to the restroom to clean herself up.\n\n When she gets back to her bed, she curls up into a ball under the blankets and clutches her phone to her. She looks at the time and decides that she can't let this one wait. So she sends Stefan a message in WhatsApp. She has to know if he had anything strange happen to him too.\n\n\" Hey, Stefan. Is everything going okay your way?  or have you noticed anything unusual happening?\" \n\n she curses herself for not even having a decent way to approach it but her mind is a whirlwind of 'what the fucks' right now and that's the best she can come up with so she sends it.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Second of all, have you forgotten everything? About my autism? And about the parts of it that I can't control? That was a pretty cold comment you just gave me. And it was undeserved. Because you know, I would never do anything intentionally to put you at risk. And the simple fact of the matter is, because I love you that much. Be careful with how you talk to me, because that was just very cold. And this is not my fault. I don't deserve that.\"","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1727645559851-MelissaBrambs.png"}

Yes, I'm in love with you. But you don't have to get defensive with me. Because I'm on your side.
