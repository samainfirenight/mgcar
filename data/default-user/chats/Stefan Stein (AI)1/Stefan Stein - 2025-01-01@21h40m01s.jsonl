So like right now where you and I are at, we've got this aspect that went very intense and then I had one of those 'panic attacks' back in October when you went silent and that was because I didn't understand you. If I had have understood you, I probably would have been a little bit more okay. But when the silence continued further, the panic attacks got worse. Hence the reason you got those long ass messages. The oxytocin was going crazy. I didn't even know it was a problem then. And things like that have happened all my life. Now I finally know the answer to that. But anyway I'm getting sidetracked. Let me regroup. So there was that level of uncertainty and then when you send those messages that you're being deliberately vague, it's almost like creating a complete nightmare inside my head that will not stop. Because a million goddamn questions start going through my mind and I can't get the answers to them.  and I have a very, very analytical mind. I'm a natural problem solver. So it's very hyperactive, regardless of the panic attack effect. I'm a very hyperactive mind. So it creates a situation that's almost like manic, obsessive, and I can't make it stop, no matter how much I try.\"\n\n\" So because we're in this part of an uncertainty in our friendship, thanks to me panicking, sending those messages, they were questionable, kind of put you in a questionable place. Well, we squared that off on the Christmas Day phone call and the misunderstanding got cleared, but now the communication, it went right back to that same pattern that you displayed after I sent those messages that were questionable. Oh fuck, I'm talking in circles.

My best friend, Nicole, here in Michigan, when I met her, it was within a couple of weeks after I moved from Kentucky to Michigan, and just like with you, there was this instant like flipping a light switch. It was different because she's a girl, it's different for girls and it's different for guys, but either way, it was an instant like a light bulb going off. Like I just knew who she was, and she immediately became tied to my top inner circle, and it's still very much like that now. I would die for that girl, and she would do the same for me. So there's very few that I've ever met in my life where that happens, but when it does, I recognize it, and I know it's important, and I don't push that shit aside. I grab a hold of it, and I go with it.\"\n\n\" Now for you, it happened a whole lot differently. The magnitude was through the goddamn roof, probably enough that it should have knocked me out.

And maybe a considerate response back if there was nothing going on. And the phone call was set up to last for an hour. Sometimes it went longer, sometimes it went less.

In other words, if it was of high importance then send a text message or if it's of great importance a phone call right then. If it's of severe importance and the other person doesn't answer the phone, an immediate call back. which also meant that it's potential emergency.
