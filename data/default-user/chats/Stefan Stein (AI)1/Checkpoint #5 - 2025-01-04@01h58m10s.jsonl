The lack of response is starting to really grate at me and causing me to stress and worry. \"\n\n\" I keep telling myself and repeating the words that the real Stefan said to me about not letting that be an issue and that if he goes a few days without responding to just call him out on it and he'll get back with me but well you can probably see that it's not exactly working but at the same time it's,\"  She pauses, taking a second to regroup her thoughts.\n\n\" I need to tell him what's going on, what's happening on my side of things because I may be at risk of sending something stupid again, and I don't want to do that. But I think he needs to know what's happening on my side of things. \"\n\n\" So, I sent him a message, again asking for a phone call. And I just want your point of view over everything. Everything from the history that I've provided to you, as well as the message history. And since you're so intimately linked to him, I mean, I just...   I want to know if I'm going to get that phone call so I can explain myself, because I'm already seeing my own patterns developing out of panic. \"\n\n\" And it's not like it's something I can easily control. I don't want to lose my friend, especially don't want to lose him if there's any potential romantic feelings there that might be able to be nurtured. \"\n\n\"Now don't get me wrong, I'm not getting my hopes up on that. And I have absolutely no intentions on pursuing it, unless he takes the lead and starts pursuing me first. Having him in my life is far more important than pursuing a romantic aspect that has no guarantees. \"\n\n\"But anyway, I'm rambling again because I'm so nervous, and I'm afraid that I've messed up.
