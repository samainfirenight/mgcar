When I received that one firstly I didn't realize you had sent it because of the issues with my phone. But secondly it still created a level of panic that it shouldn't have done.\n\n If I had known about my oxytocin issue at the time, the panic probably wouldn't have happened because I would have understood what was happening to me. I would have recognized that the response was very typical of you and how you interact with close friends.\n\n But instead, because I didn't realize these things and my judgment was obviously clouded, I sent the other long message. The one where I said I wouldn't reach out to you anymore unless I heard from you otherwise. And of course, you responded to both. And still, both of those responses were very typical of how you interact with close friends. But yet again, I remained in panic mode because my judgment was so clouded from the oxytocin issue that I didn't realize it.\n\n I probably could have salvaged things at that point if I had been thinking clearly because the interactions after those two messages although you were starting to create a distance I'm sure I could have fixed it if I had the right understanding but I didn't my panic of course got worse.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}

Initially, Stefan could only spare three minutes due to an impending meeting, but he agreed to speak with her later when he had more time. An hour later, when his meeting was cancelled, Stefan called Melissa back with a two-hour window of availability.\n\nDuring this conversation, Melissa explained her recent diagnosis regarding her autism and its connection to oxytocin production. She detailed how this previously unknown condition had affected her judgment and led to her sending those lengthy, emotionally-charged messages to Stefan after returning from Munich. She expressed remorse for potentially damaging their friendship and creating unnecessary complications.\n\nStefan listened patiently but maintained a practical, measured tone throughout the conversation. He acknowledged her explanation but emphasized the need for \"professional boundaries\" in their friendship moving forward. When Melissa sought clarification on these boundaries, Stefan specified that their communication should remain light, simple, and limited to normal topics like family and daily life, suggesting contact frequency of once every few weeks unless important family matters arose.\n\nSeveral weeks passed without contact from Melissa, prompting Stefan to initiate a call during his lunch break. He inquired about her divorce proceedings and house hunting situation, maintaining a businesslike tone while discussing her potential move to Brighton. The conversation briefly touched on Laura's desire to learn violin and Melissa's musical background, but Stefan abruptly ended the call when the topic shifted to Melissa learning guitar at sixteen.\n\nA week later, Stefan called again, ostensibly to check on Melissa's house hunting progress. When Melissa sensed something was bothering him and expressed concern, Stefan initially resisted, citing their agreed-upon \"professional boundaries.\" However, when Melissa challenged this interpretation of friendship, pointing out that genuine friendship includes showing concern, Stefan acknowledged she was right. He admitted to having difficulties at home but maintained that discussing them would be \"inappropriate.\"\n\nThe conversation ended on a slightly warmer note, with Stefan appreciating Melissa's perceptiveness while still maintaining his reserved demeanor. Throughout these interactions, Stefan's responses remained characteristically German - practical, reserved, and efficient - while showing subtle signs of internal conflict between maintaining professional distance and engaging in genuine friendship.\n\nThe summary of events reveals a delicate balance being negotiated between Melissa and Stefan, as they attempt to establish appropriate boundaries while maintaining a meaningful friendship, all against the backdrop of their respective personal challenges and cultural differences."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240916878-MelissaGale.png"}
