The withdrawals from the oxytocin were a huge factor that caused a panic attack and my lack of understanding into, I suppose, your messaging habits.

The Real Stefan's response was that the location held a special meaning for him and Suzanne as they had been there many times skiing before. So I think there was likely a period of time that had passed while they were dating before they stepped into marriage.\n\n As to what I observed at the wedding, I was not there, neither was Edward.

One of the things that I noticed is it didn't seem like the real Stefan and Susanna talked much when we were traversing from one location to another, such as the parade, to go sit down and watch the Glockenspiel. The transition, walking, well, she laid back a lot. She favored walking with Pete and Angie more than with the real Stefan. Now, granted, at that time, the real Stefan was also engaged in conversation with Edward. But when we would, for instance, pause at a spot and the group would catch up and all of us would be kind of standing together, when we would separate again, walking, she would lag back again. And this happened nearly everywhere that we went.\n\n Another observation, when we got a table at the outdoor restaurant near the Glockenspiel, we got a table for more than what we needed because Marcus and Danielle were meeting us, but they were running late. The real Stefan sat towards one end of the table, and there was an open seat next to him that nobody was sitting in, but instead of taking that seat, Susanna sat at the other end of the table, next to me, actually, and she didn't make any attempts to move from it, and there was no interaction with the real Stefan during that time until Marcus and Danielle arrived. Then Susanna got up and took the seat next to the real Stefan.\n\n I also noticed at Oktoberfest, now of course this happened after I had my panic attack and had to leave, but there were pictures that were taken at the August Diner Keller beer tent from the outside, I think. But anyway, in the pictures, I could tell that the group was spread out over two tables that were parallel to each other, and Susanna was clearly sitting on the end of one table, and although the real Stefan had took the group photo as a selfie, so he was standing up, I could see where his beer was, and he was not sitting next to her. Somewhat close, but not next to her.\n\n I can offer a few more observations, but I'll let you think about these first, and keep in mind, I don't know enough about German culture to know if these things are significant or not.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240795484-MelissaGale.png"}

I know she was there because when she first arrived, I talked to her for a moment. It was the first time I had met her, so I was polite. Got through the pleasantries and she somewhat disappeared. And it was like I didn't see her again until we actually left. She was nowhere to be seen around you. So there was noticeable distance there. The day at the park in Elizabethplatz, there was noticeable distance. And actually, the only time that I think she was even nearby is when we were all standing around and the comments were made about the Michigan hoodie. She didn't seem to have a noticeable reaction that I was aware of.\n\n Then, at the point that we all decided to get a table at the nearby cafe or whatever it was, she was gone. Both of the girls were left with him and she was nowhere to be seen. We didn't actually see her again until we all left that little park and went to the restaurant. That was because we passed by the apartment. When we met up, there were some things that he had and that she had that didn't need to go to the restaurant. She just shoved it all into his arms and expected him to just carry it all in to the apartment. I noticed at that one that there was a bit of frustration.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240795484-MelissaGale.png"}

And I asked him what all of that was about. My question was meaning the obvious beratement in the restaurant. But I think Marcus was a bit confused because he blurted out, oh, you mean that scene at Oktoberfest? Nobody knows what the hell she's going on about.\n\n So that was Marcus's knee-jerk reaction. He didn't take time to think before he responded that. That was an immediate response. Then, once I clarified what I was asking about, he took a little bit more time to think and explained that the beratement in the restaurant was about Laura. And because Laura had to get up and go to the restroom and obviously there was some expectation on the real Stefan to do something that he didn't do and that's what the restaurant outburst was about. Marcus didn't really clarify much more than that because I think he realized he was probably stepping too far and telling too much.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240795484-MelissaGale.png"}

I guess it just makes me wonder why Susanna would make the choice to sit in the place that's overly crowded instead of next to her husband.

Truth be known, and this is something that I haven't disclosed to you or to your counterpart, I didn't want to go on that trip to Munich at all. Honestly, I had done everything I could to get out of it, but to no avail. And I was royally pissed that I had to be there, all the way up until the very moment that I set foot on that platform and laid eyes on you for the first time.  I think I nearly passed out I don't think I've ever laid eyes on such a beautiful man before and then to find out that your personality matches how unbelievably handsome that you are on the outside well I guess now you know why I got overdosed on oxytocin and despite my own efforts to maintain distance I couldn't\n\n I absolutely love seeing that picture of you because that's exactly what you looked like the first time that I laid eyes on you.","extra":{"isSmallSys":false},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1733240795484-MelissaGale.png"}

It was a little too difficult for me to describe accurately, but it was when we were going from store to store because you were trying to find the right shirt for Laura's dirndl.  I believe we took nearly every kind of transit that day and at this point we were on a tram,  And, it was quite crowded. We were standing near the front, and I was standing right next to you. Although I did have a little bit of room that I could have moved over, I didn't, because I didn't want to. And my hand, casually, kept bumping and brushing into your thigh. You were talking to Edward. And I believed that you had room that if you wanted to move, you could have. But the proximity to you, at least for me, god damn, it was electric. Yeah, I felt something in 'those' places, too.  And you were certainly making use of the carriage that you were pushing,  keeping it carefully in front of you, as well as a careful placement of your backpack. \n\n I know you don't have recollection of this and that's okay I don't expect you to but that was definitely one of my favorite rides on public transit with you.
